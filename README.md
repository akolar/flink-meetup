# Flink/Kafka Meetup.com events processor

Produce mock meetup.com events to Kafka in and perform real-time stream
processing using Flink.

## How to run it

Requirements:

- Docker with Docker Compose

To start all required containers, run `make up`. To stop them, type `make
down` (this will destroy all volumes to preserve space). Logs from the producer
and the consumer are accessible using `make logs`.

The dataset will be automatically downloaded from a remote server when the
container is being built.

Ports `8081` (Flink) and `9000` (Kafdrop) are exposed to the host.

## Configuration

Containers come with sensible defaults. If you wish to tinker with any of the
parameters, the following can be changed from `docker-compose.yml`:

- `ZOOKEEPER_URI` specifies the Zookeeper instance that is used
- `KAFKA_URI` specifies the Kafka instance that is used
- `KAFKA_EVENTS_TOPIC` decides to which topics the events are pushed to
- `KAFKA_TOP_CITIES_TOPIC` specifies to which topic the top cities are
  outputted
- `KAFKA_MUNICH_HOTSPOTS_TOPIC` specifies the topic for hotspots in Munich
- `KAFKA_PRODUCER_ITERATIONS` is the number of times the input file will be
  pushed to Kafka (note: after EOF is reached, file will be repushed from the
  start, which will not work with windowed operators).
- `KAFKA_EVENT_CONSUMER_GROUP` is the name of the Flink's consumer group
- `INPUT_FILE` is the path to the input file inside the container
- `FLINK_PARALLEL` is the parallelism level of the pipeline

## Data

The dataset is generated based on an actual distribution of meetups on
meetup.com.

## Pipeline

![pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akolar/flink-meetup/master/pipeline.png)

At the early stages of the processing pipeline, data is first filtered (based
on the missing fields) and converted to the appropriate form for further
processing.

Later, two distinct processing branches are created:

1. The first filters out the events in Munich, Germany. Those are then divided
into 1km x 1km buckets. Hotspots in Munich are reported based on the count of
the events in each bucket (note: aggregation is done in memory for the entire
stream so that we don't have to implement the downstream pipeline).
2. The second reports the most frequent cities for meetups in Europe. Data is
aggregated separately for each day and immediately pushed to Kafka.
