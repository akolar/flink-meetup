Podríamos identificar este enfoque como una transformación guiada por el cambio en la forma de hacer las cosas.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>Este tipo de transformaciones se ven desafiadas muy frecuentemente al tiempo que las personas cambian de proyectos, de áreas, se suman nuevas personas, etc. Tanto es el desafío que enfrentan, que algunas veces se ve una total retracción de la agilidad, volviendo a hacer las cosas como si aquí nunca haya existido una transformación.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>En esta conversación veremos algunos factores que influyen en este tipo de situaciones y analizaremos una dimensión de la transformación organizacional a la cual no se le da la prioridad que merece. Y esta dimensión es, justamente, el factor principal por la cual las transformaciones fallan en su cometido.<\/p> \n<p>¿Qué es eso que estamos olvidando al pretender acompañar a una organización en su transformación? Participa de la conversación y descubrámoslo juntos. Abramos la puerta hacia adentro.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p><b>Día, Hora y Lugar<\/b> <br>• Día: Miércoles 9 de Noviembre de 2016 <br>• Hora: 19:30 a 21:00 horas <br><b>• Lugar: <a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=Bulevar%20Espa%C3%B1a%202323%2C%20Montevideo\">Pyxis Edificio<\/a>&nbsp;<\/b><span>Bulevar España 2323, Montevideo&nbsp;<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>¡Gracias Pyxis por recibirnos nuevamente!<\/span><\/p> \n<p>¡Te esperamos!<\/p>","mtime":1478608240757,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AgileUY\/events\/235127267\/","yes_rsvp_count":50,"duration":5400000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Bienvenid@s, la puerta abre hacia adentro.

Many films of recent years have been set in classrooms, but few have been as intense, well played and succinct as Biček's directorial debut.<br><\/p>\n<p>Robert, the new German teacher, is aloof, authorative and demanding. He lectures on Thomas Mann and expects his pupils to rise when he enters the room. He might even be a Nazi, the dismayed teenagers speculate. When his student Sabina takes her own life shortly after being reprimanded by Robert, the teacher is considered to be cause. Instantly, vengeful youth rebellion stirs among the benches. The realisation that things are not so black and white comes too late.<br><\/p>\n<p><b>Awards:<\/b>&nbsp; 20 wins &amp; 5 nominations<br><b>IMDB rating:<\/b>&nbsp;7.8<br><b>Running time:<\/b>&nbsp; 1 hour 52 mins<\/p>\n<p>The movie will start at 7.30pm, but I will get there from about 7.00pm to set up the room.

You will see what dynamics have led to the situation\/issue and will be able to address the root of it by being held in a safe space with healing words and expression of emotions. This is a creative, intuitive process and goes very deep, but may give you sustainable results. A new perspective plus higher awareness, as well as a changed attitude will help you see your path ahead more clearly and eventually lead into more peace within yourself.<\/p> \n<p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ring me on 07894434295.<\/p> \n<p>If money is what is holding you back, please talk to me.

Harry's charming, down-home manner hides a malicious penchant for stirring up trouble, and he exerts a strange and powerful effect on Gideon and his thoroughly assimilated black, middle-class family.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s5PWGIb6vhc\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s5PWGIb6vhc<\/a><\/p>\n<p>What: To Sleep with Anger&nbsp;<br>When: Tuesday, November 8, 2015 &nbsp;7:00 PM&nbsp;<br>Where: BloomBars - community&nbsp;arts space.&nbsp;<br>Directions:&nbsp;The location is 7 minutes walking distance from the Columbia Heights METRO Station (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/Columbia+Heights+Station\/BloomBars,+11th+Street,+NW,+Washington,+DC\/@38.9294136,-77.0323002,17z\/am=t\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x89b7c81f9c6e6db9:0x42caacd52fed6e75!2m2!1d-77.032427!2d38.9288997!3m4!1m2!1d-77.0297201!2d38.9292322!3s0x89b7c81ef0f6edc7:0xdfa91290fd4d63d0!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c81ea440c991:0xb5cc9930df8a4884!2m2!1d-77.0280419!2d38.9302017!3e2\">map<\/a>), and a couple of local parking garages - Target (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/DC+USA,+3100+14th+St+NW,+Washington,+DC+20010\/BloomBars,+11th+Street,+NW,+Washington,+DC\/@38.9299782,-77.0347272,16z\/am=t\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c821d7205bad:0x6bd75c5465c0029c!2m2!1d-77.0331896!2d38.9295547!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c81ea440c991:0xb5cc9930df8a4884!2m2!1d-77.0280419!2d38.9302017!3e2\">map<\/a>) and Giant (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/Giant,+1345+Park+Rd+NW,+Washington,+DC+20010\/BloomBars,+3222+11th+Street,+NW,+Washington,+DC+20001\/@38.9307373,-77.0324329,17z\/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x89b7c81f38e9007f:0x1173e4be652e2e68!2m2!1d-77.0320803!2d38.9308112!3m4!1m2!1d-77.0286351!2d38.9306927!3s0x89b7c81eb1a15479:0xb5ca9b35c14bef2a!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c81ea440c991:0xb5cc9930df8a4884!2m2!1d-77.0280419!2d38.9302017!3e2\">map<\/a>).<\/p>","mtime":1478608670387,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DCHistoryAndCulture\/events\/235437550\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"duration":7200000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Election Night Escape! 90's Classic \"To Sleep with Anger\" w\/ Q&A","id":"235437550","time":1478649600000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"Washington","name":"Washington, DC History & Culture","group_lon":-77.06,"id":6913562,"state":"DC","urlname":"DCHistoryAndCulture","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/e\/e\/highres_449351502.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/e\/e\/600_449351502.jpeg","photo_id":449351502,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/e\/e\/thumb_449351502.jpeg"},"group_lat":38.94},"status":"upcoming"}

Last year, this trip and workshop filled up less than two weeks after it was announced!&nbsp;These trips are very popular and only a limited number of people are allowed to go down the Grand Canyon each year.

It’s still officially “Summer” on our first three days, so it should be nice and warm. Although it rarely gets over 100 degrees at this time of the year, a quick dip in the water will cool you off. The large, motorized J-rig rafts are very safe and roomy (we will have 14 people on each boat compared to the normal 18). There are about 15 white water rapids on this 100-mile stretch of the Colorado. You have the option of staying fairly dry in the back of the raft, or getting wet in the front. All your meals are prepared for you (the food is amazing), and all your camping equipment is provided (cots, tents, sleeping bags, chairs and a water-resistant bag to place your camera and other personals). There is very little hiking involved. All transportation and transfers from Las Vegas to and from the river are provided.<\/p> \n<p><b>Weather<\/b>: Mid-September offers the perfect temperatures! May and Sept. are the best months to visit the bottom of the canyon. Day temps are usually 85º - 95º, with evening temps between 65º - 75º. April can be a little cold. June, July and August are often over 100º in the day. The canyon walls radiate stored heat into the evening, typically keeping the temperatures above 80º much of the night.<\/p> \n<p><b>See the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernriver.com\/grand-canyon-rafting-tour#prettyPhoto\/0\/\">Overview\/Video<\/a> and Download the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernriver.com\/downloads\/expedition-guides\/grand_canyon_gc4.pdf\">Brochure<\/a><\/b><\/p> \n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/4\/9\/600_454593353.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><b>This is one of my few group workshops for 2017<\/b>: most are <a href=\"http:\/\/intothenightphoto.blogspot.com\/2015\/09\/private-nightscape-photography.html\">private workshops<\/a> (with 2-4 people per workshop) going on next year.

Your transition from civilization to wilderness includes horseback trail rides, horseshoes, ping pong, skeet shooting, dinner and evening entertainment before settling into bed in the lodge, outdoors in a covered wagon, or outside on a spacious deck.

Participating in Kaggle competitions can be very time-consuming. For this reason, I would like to build an automatic machine learning solution that suits most of the datasets with reasonable results. This talk also gives an overview of the main functions in H2O as well as real-world use cases.<\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;20h15-21h Sparkling Water 2.0 - Jakub Háva<\/p> \n<p>Sparkling Water integrates the H2O open source distributed machine learning platform with the capabilities of Apache Spark. It allows users to leverage H2O’s machine learning algorithms with Apache Spark applications via Scala, Python, R or H2O’s Flow GUI which makes Sparkling Water a great enterprise solution. Sparkling Water 2.0 was built to coincide with the release of Apache Spark 2.0 and introduces several new features. These include the ability to use H2O frames as Apache Spark’s SQL datasource, transparent integration into Apache Spark machine learning pipelines, the power to use Apache Spark algorithms via the Flow GUI and easier deployment of Sparkling Water in a Python environment. In this talk we will introduce the basic architecture of Sparkling Water and provide an overview of the new features available in Sparkling Water 2.0. The talk will also include a live demo showing how to integrate H2O algorithms into Apache Spark pipelines – no terminal needed!<\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;21h jusqu’au bout de la nuit :<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/xe-uYwXsYLbQ-OPlvvOhQSwX1ycpWfUwed0NAlT7vzt5Ykz5bIU9n6Zkq2aIRAh7Ne6ij7fRv7atJUwin1XV7hRNkgz33X8y2JWrq0aY5g4hSBVZn7krh3d-MStT1I8bAeJAqCdv\" width=\"624\" height=\"268\"><\/p> \n<br> \n<p><b>About Joe <\/b><\/p> \n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow\">https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow<\/a> <\/p> \n<p>Twitter: @matlabulous<\/p> \n<p>Jo-fai (or Joe) is a data scientist at H2O.ai.

Therefore, we have developed a progressive focus for our classes that starts with clearing the pain and helping us “survive life”, and progresses to finding and living our soul’s mission so that we can “thrive in life”. The Basic level training works at the 1st (physical) and 2nd (emotional) pair of the 12 Strand DNA and provides students with the ability to clear physical and emotional energy blockages from the cellular memory and leave in their place positive physical and emotional energy imprints. Even though we call this class “basic level” this class provides you with everything you need to do a powerful Integrated Energy Therapy session on yourself or on another person (either in person or absentee). This class has been designed to be a wonderful entry level class for those students wanting to use energy therapy to heal their lives, an ideal class for students wanting to begin an energy therapy practice, and it provides a wonderful complement to other holistic techniques such as Massage, Reiki, and Therapeutic Touch.

Everything is provided for in this workshop: prepared meals, air transfers from Las Vegas to the river and back, camping equipment, entertainment, and great photo instruction by NightScape Photographer, Royce Bair.<\/p>\n<p>Four experienced river guides and an assistant photo instructor will accompany us on this adventure.&nbsp;<span>This trip and workshop will be very similar to our <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NightScape-Photography\/events\/227515545\/\">2016 trip\/workshop<\/a><span> (check out our 5-star rating and comments).<\/span><\/p> \n<p><b>Don't delay making your reservations<\/b>. Last year, this trip and workshop filled up less than two weeks after it was announced!&nbsp;These trips are very popular and only a limited number of people are allowed to go down the Grand Canyon each year. Some individuals have waited for up to 20 years to obtain a permit to float through the canyon.<\/p>\n<p><b>Total Price<\/b>: Photo workshop fee is $200 ($299 after Dec. 31, 2016). River rafting cost is $1699 ($1899 total).

It’s still officially “Summer” on our September schedule, so it should be nice and warm. Although it rarely gets over 100 degrees at this time of the year, a quick dip in the water will cool you off. The large, motorized J-rig rafts are very safe and roomy (we will have 14 people on each boat compared to the normal 18). There are about 15 white water rapids on this 100-mile stretch of the Colorado. You have the option of staying fairly dry in the back of the raft, or getting wet in the front. All your meals are prepared for you (the food is amazing), and all your camping equipment is provided (cots, tents, sleeping bags, chairs and a water-resistant bag to place your camera and other personals). There is very little hiking involved. All transportation and transfers from Las Vegas to and from the river are provided.<\/p> \n<p><b>Weather<\/b>: Mid-September offers the perfect temperatures! May and Sept. are the best months to visit the bottom of the canyon. Day temps are usually 85º - 95º, with evening temps between 65º - 75º. April can be a little cold. June, July and August are often over 100º in the day. The canyon walls radiate stored heat into the evening, typically keeping the temperatures above 80º much of the night.<\/p> \n<p><b>See the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernriver.com\/grand-canyon-rafting-tour#prettyPhoto\/0\/\">Overview\/Video<\/a> and Download the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernriver.com\/downloads\/expedition-guides\/grand_canyon_gc4.pdf\">Brochure<\/a><\/b><\/p> \n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/4\/9\/600_454593353.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><b>This is one of my few group workshops for 2017<\/b>: most are <a href=\"http:\/\/intothenightphoto.blogspot.com\/2015\/09\/private-nightscape-photography.html\">private workshops<\/a> (with 2-4 people per workshop) going on next year.

A motor coach will take you to the Boulder Terminal where you will begin your Grand Canyon tour with a beautiful flight to the Bar 10 Ranch. Before you start your three-day Grand Canyon river rafting adventure, you’ll enjoy an overnight stay at the Bar 10 Ranch, a working cattle ranch perched high on a plateau above the Colorado River. Your transition from civilization to wilderness includes horseback trail rides, horseshoes, ping pong, skeet shooting, dinner and evening entertainment before settling into bed in the lodge, outdoors in a covered wagon, or outside on a spacious deck. Those who have paid the additional $200 photo instruction fee will attend a 2-hour twilight and starry night workshop instruction with Royce Bair before bedding down for the night.<\/p> \n<p><b>DAY 2<\/b> » After a big country breakfast, a helicopter takes you deep into Grand Canyon where your rafts and guides await. After orientation and introductions, you’ll be on your way downriver surrounded by soul-stirring scenery. Breathtaking canyon walls shoot skyward in a dramatic display of geologic history as you experience your first taste of Grand Canyon river rafting. Hold on for Kolb and Mile 209 Rapids!

It’s still officially “Summer” on our September schedule, so it should be nice and warm. Although it rarely gets over 100 degrees at this time of the year, a quick dip in the water will cool you off. The large, motorized J-rig rafts are very safe and roomy (we will have 14 people on each boat compared to the normal 18). There are about 15 white water rapids on this 100-mile stretch of the Colorado. You have the option of staying fairly dry in the back of the raft, or getting wet in the front. All your meals are prepared for you (the food is amazing), and all your camping equipment is provided (cots, tents, sleeping bags, chairs and a water-resistant bag to place your camera and other personals). There is very little hiking involved. All transportation and transfers from Las Vegas to and from the river are provided.<\/p> \n<p><b>Weather<\/b>: Mid-September offers the perfect temperatures! May and Sept. are the best months to visit the bottom of the canyon. Day temps are usually 85º - 95º, with evening temps between 65º - 75º. April can be a little cold.

Before you start your three-day Grand Canyon river rafting adventure, you’ll enjoy an overnight stay at the Bar 10 Ranch, a working cattle ranch perched high on a plateau above the Colorado River. Your transition from civilization to wilderness includes horseback trail rides, horseshoes, ping pong, skeet shooting, dinner and evening entertainment before settling into bed in the lodge, outdoors in a covered wagon, or outside on a spacious deck. Those who have paid the additional $200 photo instruction fee will attend a 2-hour twilight and starry night workshop instruction with Royce Bair before bedding down for the night.<\/p> \n<p><b>DAY 2<\/b> » After a big country breakfast, a helicopter takes you deep into Grand Canyon where your rafts and guides await. After orientation and introductions, you’ll be on your way downriver surrounded by soul-stirring scenery.

I had my first solo art exhibit in NYC, and I simply couldn't focus on anything else, but that's done, and I'm ready to get this back up and running! Since I'm a little late getting this out for this month, I'm moving the date to the very end of November to give us a little more time.<\/p>\n<p>So, the book for November is&nbsp;<span>November- 'Between the World and Me' by Ta Nehisi Coates.&nbsp;In a series of essays, written as a letter to his son, Coates confronts the notion of race in America and how it has shaped American history, many times at the cost of black bodies and lives. Thoughtfully exploring personal and historical events, from his time at Howard University to the Civil War, the author poignantly asks and attempts to answer difficult questions that plague modern society. In this short memoir, the \"Atlantic\" writer explains that the tragic examples of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and those killed in South Carolina are the results of a systematically constructed and maintained assault to black people--a structure that includes slavery, mass incarceration, and police brutality as part of its foundation. From his passionate and deliberate breakdown of the concept of race itself to the importance of the Black Lives Matter movement, Coates powerfully sums up the terrible history of the subjugation of black people in the United States. A timely work, this title will resonate with all teens--those who have experienced racism as well as those who have followed the recent news coverage on violence against people of color.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/08\/17\/books\/review\/ta-nehisi-coates-between-the-world-and-me.html?_r=0\">http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/08\/17\/books\/review\/ta-nehisi-coates-between-the-world-and-me.html?_r=0<\/a><br><\/p>\n<p>See you then!<\/p>\n<p>Angelique<\/p>","mtime":1478609159489,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/books-drinks\/events\/235437629\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"payment_required":"0","name":"The book for November is November- 'Between the World and Me' by Ta Nehisi Coate","id":"235437629","time":1480546800000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"Asheville","name":"asheville books & drinks","group_lon":-82.5,"id":12506782,"state":"NC","urlname":"books-drinks","category":{"name":"book clubs","id":18,"shortname":"book-clubs"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/c\/2\/highres_403079842.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/c\/2\/600_403079842.jpeg","photo_id":403079842,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/c\/2\/thumb_403079842.jpeg"},"group_lat":35.59},"status":"upcoming"}

Water Street (Route 43) and head onto the Portage Bike and Hike Crain Avenue trailhead in Kent. You pass the site where Captain Samuel Brady, famed Indian fighter and legendary Kent figure, made his famous leap across the Cuyahoga River. Heading east on the Bike and Hike along an active rail line, you pass Rockwell Road and Beckwith Orchards on your way to Towner’s Woods County Park.<\/p> \n<p>Cycling through heavy woods covering the trail to Ravenna, you are welcomed to Ravenna by factories and residential neighborhoods. Passing under Route 14, the trail continues to Peck Road where you turn. Cycle back to Kent enjoying the sights and sounds of nature along the trail.<\/p> \n<p>Note: We meet at Riverside Wine. Park in their north parking lot on the other side of the neighboring house. Out and back rides are designed with the intermediate and advanced cyclist in mind. These rides cycle out of a trailhead to a set destination, typically 8-10 miles away. After a break, the riders cycle back to the departure trailhead.<\/p> \n<p>Tonight’s ride travels at 10-12 mph and typically takes 2 hours including photo-ops and rest stops. The ride is rated for leisure cyclists who enjoy cycling 10-12 mph on flat trails with an occasional hill or elevation gain.

For ladies, semi-formal probably means a dress or skirt, but I will let people decide for themselves how they want to look their best. <br> <br>There will be a non-refundable $5 charge in order to help prevent no-shows and last minute RSVP changes, so only sign up if you're sure you can make it.&nbsp; The $5 charge does not include the price of your food &amp; drinks. <\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/6\/7\/600_455892391.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> If anyone wants to help plan games, that would be much appreciated.&nbsp; It would be nice to try to plan some interactive games so that we can get to know each other a little better, or if people just prefer to mingle, that's fine too. If you help with the planning of the event, there will not be a charge for you. The venue closes at 6pm, so we'll have 3 hours to hang out of we need that much time. <br> <\/p> \n<p>Couples are welcome, but you will both need to RSVP individually. <br><br>If this event is a success, we will plan more like it in the future. <br> <br>See you there! <\/p>","mtime":1478609201565,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/singles-1350\/events\/235437559\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"payment_required":"1","name":"Semi-formal Meet & Greet at Jammy Buggars in Lakewood (Guys' RSVP Page)","id":"235437559","time":1481486400000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"Cleveland","name":"The Cleveland 20s and 30s Group","group_lon":-81.68,"id":693119,"state":"OH","urlname":"singles-1350","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/0\/5\/highres_454905317.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/0\/5\/600_454905317.jpeg","photo_id":454905317,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/0\/5\/thumb_454905317.jpeg"},"group_lat":41.51},"status":"upcoming"}

A retreat with others may also energize and deepen mindfulness, as well as help to strengthen a sense of sangha (community of spiritual friends).<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>With these things in mind, we would like to, whenever possible, provide a free monthly half day meditation retreat for those wishing to deepen their mindfulness practice. The location is a private residence in an ideal setting for meditation and a great place to enjoy the beauty of the North Georgia mountains. All you need to bring is the willingness to unplug from your hectic life for a few hours. Meditation cushions and chairs are provided. There is <b>no cost<\/b> for this retreat. Directions to the retreat site and meeting agenda are below.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Bio:<\/strong> Mark is an Insight Meditation teacher, who began his meditation practice more than 40 years ago with insight meditation teachers Joseph Goldstein, Sharon Salzberg, and Jack Kornfield. His primary teacher has been Joseph Goldstein, and he has trained more recently with guiding senior insight teachers Rodney Smith and Narayan Liebenson. His primary teaching emphasis is practical Essential Buddhism and how mindfulness in all aspects of daily life can&nbsp;provide an&nbsp;opportunity for awakening. &nbsp;He has studied with numerous other teachers primarily in the Theravada tradition, but also in the Tibetan and Zen traditions.<\/p> \n<p>He has done 3 three-month silent retreats and dozens of other retreats mostly at the Insight Meditation Society, the Forest Refuge, and the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies.

Beaucoup de studios y ont ainsi leur siège<br>Du crayon à l'ordinateur<br>Il est un peu petit, certes, mais on peut y passer des heures. Le Suginami Animation Museum propose une riche collection de documents sur le cinéma animé. A l'entrée, un brochure en anglais permet de faire le point. L'histoire de l'animation japonaise est ainsi retracée depuis ses origines... en 1907 !<br>Au centre du bâtiment, un mur arbore les dédicaces des grands mangaka venus y donner des conférences. Pour bien comprendre le chemin qui a été fait, une immense frise chronologique présente les grandes dates. Quelques animés d'époque sont diffusé sur une télé noir et blanc, entourée de statuettes de collection. Sur le côté, des espaces de travail sont reconstitués. Ils témoignent de l'évolution des méthodes de production du crayon à l'ordinateur <\/p> \n<p><br><\/p> \n<p>&lt;BBB&gt;<\/p> \n<p>Nakano Broadway<\/p> \n<p>C’est le lieu rêvé pour tout bon collectionneur qui se respecte!

It makes no difference whether you have or haven’t previous experience of singing or music! What is the workshop about?<br>Our sound is the simplest and most ancient of all the sources of our creative power. Many of us experienced a deep disconnection from this source at a very young age when we were told we could not sing or we had ‘no voice’. Something healing and magical occurs when we reconnect to this source and find the sound of our own heart and soul. Through it, we move into a new relationship with our creativity, our wisdom and our innate ability to heal and nurture ourselves, no matter what our journey. What will we be doing?<br>Participants will be introduced to The Naked Voice methodology of sound and voice developed by internationally renowned singer and composer Chloe Goodchild. During the day we will work with singing, silence, movement and play. Who is the Facilitator?<br>Emer has trained for many years with Chloe Goodchild and is an accredited Naked Voice Facilitator. She has also studied with the UK College of Sound Healing. Emer holds an MSc and works as a trainer in community development and holistic well-being.

In ancient Persia, there were seven sacred animals, birds, and flowers believed to have carried the spirit of the Gods. Numerous archeological antiquities and temples have been found that show the connection between animals and dance. These animals were a symbol of the power of life and represented as a spiritual instrument and these seven sacred birds each represented a certain Persian God or Goddess. These rituals and movements are considered the earliest known form of Persian dance and the origin of sacred dance. The origins of Iranian Shamanic rituals, sacred circles, and the mysteries of Sema will also be discussed.<\/p>\n<p><b>Bio: Farima Berenji<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Farima Berenji is an Iranian-born scholar and dance ethnologist, an award winning internationally acclaimed dance artist, a choreographer, instructor, and an archaeologist specializing in ancient, sacred, classical, and folkloric dances of Persia, Ionia, and the Silk Road. Farima has spent her lifetime studying Persian dance, culture, and history. She performs, offers workshops, and lectures worldwide upon request and has appeared in North America, UK, Austria, Czech Republic, Turkey, Mauritius, and Iran. Recognized as one of a few world scholarly experts of ancient and mystical dance ethnology, she travels worldwide to record, research, lecture, perform, educate, and to inspire dynamic creativity and rejuvenation through dance and movement. As a Sufi and semazen, Farima is an exceptionally inspiring instructor strongly connected to spirituality and healing. She infuses spirituality into her dance and teachings to inspire others to explore dance as a powerful means of expressing emotion, facilitating spiritual healing, and to bridge cultures. Farima teaches her own original findings, methods, techniques, and exercises to uncover the connection between the soul and dance movement. United in all her accomplishments is her contribution in advocating art, culture, and dance to help bridge cultural gaps and create respect among all people.

WHAT ARE FUCK UP NIGHTS?<\/p> \n<p>FuckUp Nights is a global movement where stories of failed businesses and projects are told, questioned and celebrated.<\/p> \n<p>The concept evolved from a mezcal-infused conversation between five friends who felt the need to break free from the stigmas surrounding \"failure\". As fellow entrepreneurs and soon-to-be fuckupreneurs, they deeply believed in communicating failure as a positive step everyone must overcome on the road to success.<\/p> \n<p>II. WHY DO WE DO IT?<\/p> \n<p>• Because the majority of professionals don't create the \"project of the year\" in their first attempt<\/p> \n<p>• Because one can learn more from stories of failure than from stories of success.<\/p> \n<p>III. HOW IS IT DONE?<\/p> \n<p>In every FuckUp Night each speaker (3 speakers in this case) tells their story: What was the project? What went wrong? What did they learn? What would they do differently?<\/p> \n<p>For updates of our speakers, future events or questions feel free to contact FuckUp Nights Sydney at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FUNSydney\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FUNSydney<\/a><\/p> \n<p>For more info check you can visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/fuckupnights.com\/\">http:\/\/fuckupnights.com\/<\/a><\/p>","mtime":1478609488209,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FuckUp-Nights-Sydney\/events\/235319988\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"payment_required":"0","name":"FuckUp Nights Sydney Vol. 3","id":"235319988","time":1479282300000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"au","city":"Sydney","name":"FuckUp Nights Sydney","group_lon":151.21,"id":19974092,"urlname":"FuckUp-Nights-Sydney","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"group_lat":-33.87},"status":"upcoming"}

This will be useful for attendees who are not familiar with H2O.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;19h30-20h15 Automatic Machine Learning using H2O - Jiqiong QIU <\/p>\n<p>In this talk, I am going to talk about a general machine learning pipeline using H2O for a Kaggle competition (data mining competition). Participating in Kaggle competitions can be very time-consuming. For this reason, I would like to build an automatic machine learning solution that suits most of the datasets with reasonable results. This talk also gives an overview of the main functions in H2O as well as real-world use cases.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;20h15-21h Sparkling Water 2.0 - Jakub Háva<\/p>\n<p>Sparkling Water integrates the H2O open source distributed machine learning platform with the capabilities of Apache Spark. It allows users to leverage H2O’s machine learning algorithms with Apache Spark applications via Scala, Python, R or H2O’s Flow GUI which makes Sparkling Water a great enterprise solution. Sparkling Water 2.0 was built to coincide with the release of Apache Spark 2.0 and introduces several new features. These include the ability to use H2O frames as Apache Spark’s SQL datasource, transparent integration into Apache Spark machine learning pipelines, the power to use Apache Spark algorithms via the Flow GUI and easier deployment of Sparkling Water in a Python environment. In this talk we will introduce the basic architecture of Sparkling Water and provide an overview of the new features available in Sparkling Water 2.0. The talk will also include a live demo showing how to integrate H2O algorithms into Apache Spark pipelines – no terminal needed!<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;21h jusqu’au bout de la nuit :<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/xe-uYwXsYLbQ-OPlvvOhQSwX1ycpWfUwed0NAlT7vzt5Ykz5bIU9n6Zkq2aIRAh7Ne6ij7fRv7atJUwin1XV7hRNkgz33X8y2JWrq0aY5g4hSBVZn7krh3d-MStT1I8bAeJAqCdv\" width=\"624\" height=\"268\"><\/p>\n<br>\n<p><b>About Joe <\/b><\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow\">https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Twitter: @matlabulous<\/p>\n<p>Jo-fai (or Joe) is a data scientist at H2O.ai.

This talk also gives an overview of the main functions in H2O as well as real-world use cases.<\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;20h15-21h Sparkling Water 2.0 - Jakub Háva<\/p> \n<p>Sparkling Water integrates the H2O open source distributed machine learning platform with the capabilities of Apache Spark. It allows users to leverage H2O’s machine learning algorithms with Apache Spark applications via Scala, Python, R or H2O’s Flow GUI which makes Sparkling Water a great enterprise solution. Sparkling Water 2.0 was built to coincide with the release of Apache Spark 2.0 and introduces several new features. These include the ability to use H2O frames as Apache Spark’s SQL datasource, transparent integration into Apache Spark machine learning pipelines, the power to use Apache Spark algorithms via the Flow GUI and easier deployment of Sparkling Water in a Python environment. In this talk we will introduce the basic architecture of Sparkling Water and provide an overview of the new features available in Sparkling Water 2.0. The talk will also include a live demo showing how to integrate H2O algorithms into Apache Spark pipelines – no terminal needed!<\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;21h jusqu’au bout de la nuit :<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/xe-uYwXsYLbQ-OPlvvOhQSwX1ycpWfUwed0NAlT7vzt5Ykz5bIU9n6Zkq2aIRAh7Ne6ij7fRv7atJUwin1XV7hRNkgz33X8y2JWrq0aY5g4hSBVZn7krh3d-MStT1I8bAeJAqCdv\" width=\"624\" height=\"268\"><\/p>\n<br> \n<p><b>About Joe <\/b><\/p> \n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow\">https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow<\/a> <\/p> \n<p>Twitter: @matlabulous<\/p> \n<p>Jo-fai (or Joe) is a data scientist at H2O.ai.

Our hike will take us&nbsp;across fields and woodlands&nbsp;before a strenuous ascent&nbsp;to Leith Hill. The summit is the highest of the&nbsp;Greensand Ridge and its tower is&nbsp;the highest point in south-east England. <br>Leith Hill will accommodate us for our lunch as it's been&nbsp;a renowned spot for picnic since the 19th century. Afterwards,&nbsp;if we're feeling energetic, we will climb the 74 spiral steps of the 18th century tower of&nbsp;Leith Hill&nbsp;to&nbsp;its top where through the telescope you can see the English Channel on a clear day. Many of London's landmarks could be seen&nbsp;with the naked eye, too.<br><br><br>After lunch,&nbsp;we descent Leith Hill to head north to Dorking via Greensand way. Much of the&nbsp;route passes ancient woods with&nbsp;amazing displays of colour.&nbsp;Greensand way will take us along paths which give unparalleled views across the Weald&nbsp;and towards the North Downs. The way passes through Tilling Springs&nbsp;- the source of&nbsp;River Tillingbourne which is 11 miles long and&nbsp;runs through several villages powering their mills along the way. From there, we will&nbsp;hike towards the hills upto the North Downs Way and pass by an old WWII&nbsp;pillbox.&nbsp; The path offers beautiful view points which overlook the valley&nbsp;towards Dorking.&nbsp;<br>Then, hiking through woodland for a while, the path comes to Ranmore Common and the beautiful church of St Barnabas built in 1860.&nbsp;From the&nbsp;Church, we continue through Denbies Wine Estate - England’s largest vineyard. The way through the Vineyard rewards with excellent views towards Dorking and Boxhill. Our hike finishes with the picturesque market town of Dorking located west from the Holmesdale hills range. <br><br><\/p> \n<p><span><span><strong>Transport and Meeting Point<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>We'll meet at Victoria station from 8:00am&nbsp;and leave the meeting point at<\/span>&nbsp;8:15 for the 8<span>:31<\/span>train<\/p> \n<p>Planed return time to London of 6:34pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for&nbsp;the&nbsp;day until then) <br><\/p> \n<p><span>We'll meet between WHSmith (no 34) and the stall called Breadbox (no 29) - both of which can be seen on the map here of our meeting point:&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/LCf81\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/LCf81<\/a><\/p> \n<p><span><span><strong> <br><\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><span><strong>Food<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p> \n<p>We will stop during the walk for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

Our hike will take us&nbsp;across fields and woodlands&nbsp;before a strenuous ascent&nbsp;to Leith Hill. The summit is the highest of the&nbsp;Greensand Ridge and its tower is&nbsp;the highest point in south-east England. <br>Leith Hill will accommodate us for our lunch as it's been&nbsp;a renowned spot for picnic since the 19th century. Afterwards,&nbsp;if we're feeling energetic, we will climb the 74 spiral steps of the 18th century tower of&nbsp;Leith Hill&nbsp;to&nbsp;its top where through the telescope you can see the English Channel on a clear day. Many of London's landmarks could be seen&nbsp;with the naked eye, too.<br><br><br>After lunch,&nbsp;we descent Leith Hill to head north to Dorking via Greensand way. Much of the&nbsp;route passes ancient woods with&nbsp;amazing displays of colour.&nbsp;Greensand way will take us along paths which give unparalleled views across the Weald&nbsp;and towards the North Downs. The way passes through Tilling Springs&nbsp;- the source of&nbsp;River Tillingbourne which is 11 miles long and&nbsp;runs through several villages powering their mills along the way. From there, we will&nbsp;hike towards the hills upto the North Downs Way and pass by an old WWII&nbsp;pillbox.&nbsp; The path offers beautiful view points which overlook the valley&nbsp;towards Dorking.&nbsp;<br>Then, hiking through woodland for a while, the path comes to Ranmore Common and the beautiful church of St Barnabas built in 1860.&nbsp;From the&nbsp;Church, we continue through Denbies Wine Estate - England’s largest vineyard. The way through the Vineyard rewards with excellent views towards Dorking and Boxhill. Our hike finishes with the picturesque market town of Dorking located west from the Holmesdale hills range. <br><br><\/p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Transport and Meeting Point<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We'll meet at Victoria station from 8:00am&nbsp;and leave the meeting point at<\/span>&nbsp;8:15 for the 8<span>:31<\/span>train<\/p>\n<p>Planed return time to London of 6:34pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for&nbsp;the&nbsp;day until then) <br><\/p>\n<p><span>We'll meet between WHSmith (no 34) and the stall called Breadbox (no 29) - both of which can be seen on the map here of our meeting point:&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/LCf81\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/LCf81<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span><span><strong> <br><\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Food<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>We will stop during the walk for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

You are welcome to bring a token to represent your intention if you so desire, and place it on the Community Altar as we journey together.<\/p>\n<p>* Areas set up for meditation, energy work, and community networking. Healthy snacks, tea and water are provided. All ages welcome! Young children should be supervised by parents\/guardians.<\/p>\n<p>* Yoga Mats \/ Back Jacks \/ Chairs available. Feel free to bring your own yoga mats for stretching or lying down.<\/p>\n<p>* We invite volunteer Reiki healers and other energy\/body workers to attend the healing area. Other volunteer opportunities are available as well. Please send us your volunteer inquiries in advance for trade possibilities. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>--------------<\/p>\n<p><b>General Guidelines and Tips<\/b><\/p>\n<p>1. We kindly ask for no talking on the dance floor. This allows for people to go deeper into their Dance and connect with their journey through the elements. (Chat and conversation is welcome in the tea room, outside, or *very* quietly just off the dance floor.)<\/p>\n<p>2. Dance however you want. There is no right or wrong way. Listen to your body and move to the way it feels. Express who you are from the inside out.<\/p>\n<p>3. Respect yourself as well as those around you. Please be mindful to make room for others as you move about the dance floor. Pay attention to your boundaries and the boundaries of others. Communicate through eye contact and body language. Be compassionate and aware. It is our highest intention that this dance is a safe space and sanctuary for community and individual self expression.<br>Suggestion: If you need space, or wish to disengage with another dancer, simply put your hands together in prayer pose and gently bow. This is a clear signal that you want to be in your own space. Mutual respect, always.<\/p>\n<p>4. Bring extra water. &nbsp;This is mainly recommended for those who get very thirsty while exercising, or have a cold.<\/p>\n<p>5. Wear clothes that make you feel good and are comfortable for dancing. Be expressive and colorful if you like, or just show up in your sweats. It's all good! Dancing barefoot or in socks is fine. Shoes are ok, but heavy tread shoes or heels are not allowed. Most dance shoes or slippers are great.<\/p>\n<p>6. This is a Clean &amp; Sober event. &nbsp;No drugs or alcohol of any kind, inside or outside of the body.&nbsp; This would cause you to be asked to leave.<\/p>\n<p>7. Do not bring cameras, or use your phone to take photos.<br><i>Ask the organizers if you have questions about this policy.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>8. ALL ages and genders are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>9. Be yourself!<\/p>\n<p>--------------<\/p>\n<p><b>TIPS FOR THE FIRST TIMER<\/b><\/p>\n<p>* &nbsp;If you have never attended before, please take a few minutes to read.<\/p>\n<p>There will be a brief orientation for newcomers&nbsp;at 8:00 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>Dance Elemental is inspired by ecstatic dance culture and nature-centered spiritual paths. Though you may have attended other ecstatic dance events, Dance Elemental is a unique expression of this form. Music is selected to take you on a journey through the four elements that leads you back to your center (spirit). This is a container created for authentic self expression through dance, meditation in motion, deep play, spiritual centering and community.<\/p>\n<p>Rediscover and liberate your heart of hearts together through dance! &nbsp;<br>We welcome all to the dance. Open your heart, and dissolve any blocks of judgment and fear. Move your body and soul to a handpicked mix of world music, tribal, funk, electronica, trance, ambient and much more. Short, guided meditations are spoken between sections to help transition us from element to element as we journey together through the experience. We are dedicated to providing this touchstone for individual wholeness, healing, growth, and community harmony. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What to expect when you arrive<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Arrive to soft music. Check in first and then quietly find a place for your things. Be welcomed with a cleansing\/smudge (sage or gentle mist). Relax, breathe and stretch as others arrive.<\/p>\n<p>We will be called together for a welcoming circle, speaking of our names, brief orientation, and grounding meditation. Then the dancing starts. &nbsp;Dancing continues until 10:45 or so.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>* Closing<\/p>\n<p>We end with a simple Heart Sharing, with a few words spoken by those who wish to speak about what they experienced, and any gratitudes, etc. There is also time allowed for community announcements just before we part. Remember you are free to bring flyers for your events and put them on the community networking table as well.<\/p>\n<p>--------------<\/p>\n<p><b>Stations&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>*&nbsp;Not to be confused with the religious variety.<\/p>\n<p>There are several \"stations\" in our shared space to help you with being present during the dance.<\/p>\n<p>1. Tea Room:&nbsp;Need a refresher? We have a lovely table with healthy snacks to help re-energize and 'ground' you. A great place to chat as well. (Yes, you may bring wholesome finger-foods or beverages to share on the table - please label contents.)<\/p>\n<p>2. Chill out zone:&nbsp;Need to be still for awhile? This is a cozy space set for meditation\/stillness.<\/p>\n<p>3. Healing: &nbsp;Feeling tapped? Reiki Practitioners and experienced Body\/Energy Workers from within our community are often available to offer their care to re-energize and align the participants.<\/p>\n<p>4. Community Altar:&nbsp;This is a space for you to focus your energy and intention, or to draw inspiration from during the dance. Everyone is invited to bring something to place on or near the altar should they feel called.<\/p>\n<p>5. Drumming:&nbsp;There are an assortment of drums\/shakers available for you to play. You may borrow available instruments, or bring your own.&nbsp;<i>Please attend children.<\/i>&nbsp;The goal is to support the dancers by adding to the energy of the music. Sensitivity and awareness is key to holding the energy in the room...&nbsp;<br>Please stay attuned to cues from the DJ and\/or facilitators.<\/p>\n<p>6. Community networking area:&nbsp;This surface is set up near the entrance so that we can get to know one another better. Bring your business cards and brochures, event flyers, freebies, etc. &nbsp;Please take a moment to look through the materials during the evening and collect anything of interest. Seek and ye shall find.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Wow!

Water Street (Route 43) and head onto the Portage Bike and Hike Crain Avenue trailhead in Kent. You pass the site where Captain Samuel Brady, famed Indian fighter and legendary Kent figure, made his famous leap across the Cuyahoga River. Heading east on the Bike and Hike along an active rail line, you pass Rockwell Road and Beckwith Orchards on your way to Towner’s Woods County Park.<\/p>\n<p>Cycling through heavy woods covering the trail to Ravenna, you are welcomed to Ravenna by factories and residential neighborhoods. Passing under Route 14, the trail continues to Peck Road where you turn. Cycle back to Kent enjoying the sights and sounds of nature along the trail.<\/p>\n<p>Note: We meet at Riverside Wine. Park in their north parking lot on the other side of the neighboring house. Out and back rides are designed with the intermediate and advanced cyclist in mind. These rides cycle out of a trailhead to a set destination, typically 8-10 miles away. After a break, the riders cycle back to the departure trailhead.<\/p>\n<p>Today's ride travels at 10-12 mph and typically takes 2 hours including photo-ops and rest stops. The ride is rated for leisure cyclists who enjoy cycling 10-12 mph on flat trails with an occasional hill or elevation gain. The trail surface is mixed with areas of both asphalt and packed limestone. It is relatively flat with some moderate elevation changes. The ride should be a comfortable ride for the intermediate cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>This ride is on the calendar of the Spin-off Cyclists . We encourage you to join us on this and other rides.

Other appearances include Partners In Crime and the short-lived ‘Rockers’ featuring Phil Lynott, Roy Wood and Chas Hodges. Additional collaborations have included Noel Redding (ex-Jimi Hendrix) and Eric Bell (ex-Thin Lizzy).<\/p> \n<p><br>During the late nineties John Coghlan’s Quo was formed and through various line-ups has enjoyed regular gigs all over the UK and Europe. From 2010 (previously performing as The John Coghlan Band) the band consisted of John on Drums with Baz Barry, Mick Hughes and Pete Knight from NWOBHM Boogie Band ‘Predatür’ completing the line-up. From May 2015, Rick Chase replaced Pete Knight on Bass.<\/p> \n<p>It should be clear this is most definitely not a “tribute” act, the prime aim being to recreate an authentic “70’s Quo Sound” in keeping with John’s time with Quo.<\/p> \n<p>John explains, “Since leaving in 1981 I’ve played with loads of guitarists and they’d say let’s stick a couple of Quo songs in and they would come unstuck. They think it is so easy and they just bluff their way through and really do a poor version.”<\/p> \n<p>“I got a call from Pete Barton who sings with The Animals, but is also a booking agent. He said you had loads of hit records; why not put a band together? I now have these guys from Predatür. Great players and they recreate the sound without this lookalike rubbish. I don’t want to discuss tribute bands because it is not our bag. Baz, Mick and Pete – we get on great and we have a good following for John Coghlan’s Quo. I still play the way I played with Quo, I haven’t changed anything. We even play down my little local Pub; we take all the furniture out! We did it once for fun and now we have done it twice a year for twenty-six years. We still attack the songs the same as at big gigs and Quo fans love it because that’s the way it should be played.”<\/p> \n<p>Aside from the expected Quo standards the Set List will often include songs that have either not been performed by Quo for many years or even on occasion, not at all. If you enjoy a combination of long-lost classic album tracks with a mixture of Quo’s Greatest Hits and delivered with a 70’s vibe, then a John Coghlan’s Quo gig is simply a must.<\/p> \n<p><a>Tickets £13.20<\/a><\/p>","mtime":1478609927980,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Hampshire-Social-Mingle\/events\/235401273\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"payment_required":"0","name":"Authentic Recreation Of 1970's Status Quo -  JOHN COGHLAN’S QUO","id":"235401273","time":1486753200000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","country":"gb","city":"Winchester","name":"Hampshire Social Mingle","group_lon":-1.32,"id":19621329,"state":"F2","urlname":"Hampshire-Social-Mingle","category":{"name":"singles","id":30,"shortname":"singles"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/a\/b\/highres_455261387.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/a\/b\/600_455261387.jpeg","photo_id":455261387,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/1\/a\/b\/thumb_455261387.jpeg"},"group_lat":51.07},"status":"deleted"}

Chelsi attended Lowell High School from[masked], where she grew a fast connection and love for ceramics. She carried this love to college where she pursued a degree in Fine Arts. Chelsi attended the University of Massachusetts in Lowell from 2008 to 2013. Here she primarily concentrated in dark room photography, sculpture, and ceramics. Part of the reason she acquired the liking for these three mediums is the hands on connection she can make with the material. Chelsi was the art teacher at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Greater Lowell where she helped youth gain inspiration for their art and life; between 2011 and 2014. Chelsi was the manager of the Ceramic Studio, Indigo Fire, in Belmont, Massachusetts.

This is a United States of fairgrounds and circuses, forgotten crossroads and neglected cityscapes. The streets are filled with depictions of bulky late 1950s automobiles, including the Ford Edsel, a famous automotive failure. .

The choice of subject matter reflects a deep affinity for the North American scene, an abiding affection for its curious roadside attractions and respect for its industrial might.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/1\/5\/4\/600_455892628.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><span>Staying out of the mainstream and travelling the back roads, freeborn style.”&nbsp; It’s a panoramic view of the US, similar to the one described in his kaleidoscopic 1975 song Tangled Up in Blue. Railways, skyscrapers, and suspension bridges vie with deserted side streets and overgrown motels for attention. This is a United States of fairgrounds and circuses, forgotten crossroads and neglected cityscapes. The streets are filled with depictions of bulky late 1950s automobiles, including the Ford Edsel, a famous automotive failure. .

Our hike will take us&nbsp;across fields and woodlands&nbsp;before a strenuous ascent&nbsp;to Leith Hill. The summit is the highest of the&nbsp;Greensand Ridge and its tower is&nbsp;the highest point in south-east England. <br>Leith Hill will accommodate us for our lunch as it's been&nbsp;a renowned spot for picnic since the 19th century. Afterwards,&nbsp;if we're feeling energetic, we will climb the 74 spiral steps of the 18th century tower of&nbsp;Leith Hill&nbsp;to&nbsp;its top where through the telescope you can see the English Channel on a clear day. Many of London's landmarks could be seen&nbsp;with the naked eye, too.<br><br><br>After lunch,&nbsp;we descent Leith Hill to head north to Dorking via Greensand way. Much of the&nbsp;route passes ancient woods with&nbsp;amazing displays of colour.&nbsp;Greensand way will take us along paths which give unparalleled views across the Weald&nbsp;and towards the North Downs. The way passes through Tilling Springs&nbsp;- the source of&nbsp;River Tillingbourne which is 11 miles long and&nbsp;runs through several villages powering their mills along the way. From there, we will&nbsp;hike towards the hills upto the North Downs Way and pass by an old WWII&nbsp;pillbox.&nbsp; The path offers beautiful view points which overlook the valley&nbsp;towards Dorking.&nbsp;<br>Then, hiking through woodland for a while, the path comes to Ranmore Common and the beautiful church of St Barnabas built in 1860.&nbsp;From the&nbsp;Church, we continue through Denbies Wine Estate - England’s largest vineyard. The way through the Vineyard rewards with excellent views towards Dorking and Boxhill. Our hike finishes with the picturesque market town of Dorking located west from the Holmesdale hills range. <br><br><\/p> \n<p><span><span><strong>Transport and Meeting Point<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>We'll meet at Victoria station from 8:00am&nbsp;and leave the meeting point at<\/span>&nbsp;8:15 for the 8<span>:31<\/span>train<\/p> \n<p>Planed return time to London of 6:34pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for&nbsp;the&nbsp;day until then) <br><\/p> \n<p><span>We'll meet between WHSmith (no 34) and the stall called Breadbox (no 29) - both of which can be seen on the map here of our meeting point:&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/LCf81\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/LCf81<\/a><\/p> \n<p><span><span><strong> <br><\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><span><strong>Food<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p> \n<p>We will stop during the walk for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

Chelsi attended Lowell High School from 2004- 2008, where she grew a fast connection and love for ceramics. She carried this love to college where she pursued a degree in Fine Arts. Chelsi attended the University of Massachusetts in Lowell from 2008 to 2013. Here she primarily concentrated in dark room photography, sculpture, and ceramics. Part of the reason she acquired the liking for these three mediums is the hands on connection she can make with the material. Chelsi was the art teacher at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Greater Lowell where she helped youth gain inspiration for their art and life; between 2011 and 2014. Chelsi was the manager of the Ceramic Studio, Indigo Fire, in Belmont, Massachusetts. Chelsi continued her education after college at MudFlat in Somerville Massachusetts where she took classes and an independent study. Currently she is growing her collection and is creating her ceramic pieces at Lowell Makes.<\/p>\n<p>You can find Chelsi's work on her <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chelsihanley.com\/\"><span>portfolio site<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>","mtime":1478610194647,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/LowellMakes\/events\/235437074\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"payment_required":"0","name":"Adult Snow Flakes Pottery Workshop","id":"235437074","time":1480874400000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"Lowell","name":"Lowell Makes","group_lon":-71.3,"id":7462972,"state":"MA","urlname":"LowellMakes","category":{"name":"tech","id":34,"shortname":"tech"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/5\/0\/highres_239261552.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/5\/0\/600_239261552.jpeg","photo_id":239261552,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/2\/5\/0\/thumb_239261552.jpeg"},"group_lat":42.63},"status":"upcoming"}

Ce cours particulier vise à vous soutenir dans le développement de vos projet artistiques.

Plants have been around since the beginning of the world and have remained safe from predators and nature. Modern day scientific studies and trends toward more natural approaches to wellness are driving a revival and new discovery of essential oil health uses, and what we're finding is that when we use Essential Oils to support our health and well-being, we're responding like the plants.

This is why I am a Wellness Advocate for doTERRA.<\/p>\n<p>During this 90-minute complimentary class we will cover the basics of doTERRA essential oils, including how to choose a quality oil, how to use them safely, and which essential oils can best support your daily routine to enhance your general health and wellness, as well as assist in alleviating many of the concerns that fill our daily lives-insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, etc. Once the class is over and I've answered all your questions and we've figured out which oils would best serve you, I'll show you the easiest options for opening an account and becoming a wholesale member.<\/p>","mtime":1478610253530,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Yin-Yoga-and-Essential-Oils\/events\/235437874\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"duration":1042200000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Essential Oils Class 101","id":"235437874","time":1478808000000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"Kingston","name":"Yin Yoga and Essential Oils","group_lon":-74.02,"id":20206039,"state":"NY","urlname":"Yin-Yoga-and-Essential-Oils","category":{"name":"health\/wellbeing","id":14,"shortname":"health-wellbeing"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/1\/8\/highres_455443800.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/1\/8\/600_455443800.jpeg","photo_id":455443800,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/b\/1\/8\/thumb_455443800.jpeg"},"group_lat":41.93},"status":"upcoming"}

While most perpetrators struggle to duplicate the signatures of one or two individuals, Cosey mastered the handwriting styles of virtually all the nation’s founders, a score of latter-day statesmen, and a number of prominent writers—both male and female. A “printer’s devil” apprentice in his youth, Cosey success stemmed from his understanding of the delicate relationship of paper and ink.

Their latest full-length album, 2014’s The Night Is Young—the fifth album by Boulder, CO-based saxophonist\/producer Dominic Lalli and drummer Jeremy Salken—saw their sound hit another dimension with its eclectic mix of tracks spanning from electronic and dance to hip-hop and electro soul.<br\/>With a provocative sound that’s as thoughtful as it is danceable, Big Gigantic weaves whirling melodies into addictive beats and samples that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Kanye West or LCD Soundsystem single. No genre is off-limits for Big Gigantic, whose breakthrough sound channels everything from funk and dub‐step to house and hip—°©‐hop.<br\/>After graduating with a master’s degree in jazz at the Manhattan School of Music, Lalli relocated to Boulder and began performing with Salken, experimenting with the idea of interpreting traditional DJ‐based music with live instruments. The duo built up early hype in 2008 with local shows and one‐offs around the country before releasing their debut album Fire It Up in 2009 and embarking on a full U.S. tour. Their other releases–Wide Awake (2009), A Place Behind The Moon (2010), 2012’s Nocturnal (which has received more than 1 million downloads to date) and The Night Is Young—have since followed. All music is available for free via the band’s website www.biggigantic.net.<br\/>Big Gigantic’s transcendent live shows are a showcase of brilliant improvisation and a tightly‐knit bond between Salken and Lalli, who breathlessly alternates between keys, sax and laptop, building a futuristic wall of sound that keeps the crowd on its feet. The marathon shows feature a variety of songs new, old and unreleased, as well as outside‐of‐the‐box remixes including Wiz Khalifa’s “Black and Yellow,” Aloe Blacc’s “I Need a Dollar” and Notorious B.I.G.’s “Notorious Thugs.”<br\/>Since forming, Big Gigantic has toured the country countless times and has become a smash on the festival circuit having performed at all major U.S. festivals including Coachella (where they brought out a local Indio, CA high school marching band during their set), Lollapalooza, Ultra Music Festival, Hangout, Austin City Limits, Governors Ball, Bonnaroo (where they’ve appeared both on their own and as Musical Director of 2014’s Skrillex Superjam performing alongside Damian “Jr. Gong” Marley, Robby Krieger, Lauryn Hill, Zedd, Mickey Hart and Janelle Monae plus more), Electric Forest and Outside Lands among many others. They have also held their own annual event at Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre called “Rowdytown,” which has sold out every year since its 2012 inception and saw an expansion to two days in 2014. Also in the fall of 2014, the duo performed at the famed Madison Square Garden in New York City supporting Bassnectar.<br\/>Big Gigantic is currently in the studio working on new music to be released in late 2015.<\/p> <p>With<\/p> <p>Illenium<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/illeniumofficial\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/illeniumofficial<\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Illenium\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Illenium<\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ILLENIUMMUSIC\" class=\"linkified\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/ILLENIUMMUSIC<\/a><br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/instagram.com\/illeniumofficial\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/instagram.com\/illeniumofficial<\/a><\/p> <p>There are melodic bass producers, and then there is Nick Miller. The Denver-based producer known as Illenium has been turning heads in the dance music community over the past year and for good reason. Illenium has distinguished himself from the myriad of others through an unrivaled ability to create an immersive emotional experience of highs and lows that pulls on the heart strings and leaves the listener awestruck, accomplishing in the span of just a few short minutes what takes many a full set. He has displayed an adeptness for creating aural arrangements that vary in style, yet always maintain beauty, complexity and emotional depth. Illenium gave the world a taste of what he has to offer in 2014 with standout originals “Falling In,” “So Wrong,” “Make Me Do;” remixes of Dawn Golden, Odesza, Oh Wonder; and performances at Global Dance Festival, Decadence NYE and other select dates. However, as foreshadowed by his inclusion in UKF’s “Ones to Watch: 15 for 2015,” this is poised to be Illenium’s breakout year.<\/p> <p>All Ages<\/p> <p>Doors 2 8pm<\/p> ","mtime":1478610563248,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Baltimore-EDM-Meetup\/events\/235437931\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"duration":18000000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Big Gigantic Concert","id":"235437931","time":1479520800000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"Baltimore","name":"Baltimore EDM Meetup","group_lon":-76.62,"id":20621281,"state":"MD","urlname":"Baltimore-EDM-Meetup","category":{"name":"music","id":21,"shortname":"music"},"group_lat":39.29},"status":"upcoming"}

David has kindly agreed to once again come and give this amazing talk to our group. Please see the feedback and video from his last event with us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are over 8 million people in London and so many different ways to connect with each other, yet many of us feel disconnected and even isolated. Meet up groups are more popular than ever and designed to bring people closer but how often have you made truly deep connections that could last a lifetime?<br><\/p> \n<p>Work colleagues, even close friends and family, are often kept at a distance because you are scared to let them see who you really are so, you show them who you think they want to see and that leaves you feeling empty and wondering if this is all there is. Well, it isn’t…….<\/p> \n<p>Who you are and what matters to you are the very reasons why people will want to connect with you. You can create deep connections that will have you feeling fulfilled, energised and will lead to powerful friendships and incredible relationships.<\/p> \n<p>When you learn how to connect deeply with your people, your personal and professional life will know no limits!<\/p> \n<br> \n<p><b>Here’s what will be covered on this interactive evening:<\/b><\/p> \n<p>Why connecting deeply can be so difficult<\/p> \n<p>What you need to do to connect, fast!<\/p> \n<p>How you are keeping ‘your’ people out of your life<\/p> \n<p>The quickest way to find ‘your’ people<\/p> \n<p>The most important thing that will create a lifelong connection<\/p> \n<p>How deep connections can support you in achieving anything you want in life<\/p> \n<br> \n<p>At the talk, not only will you learn the concepts that will have you go away able to find your people and connect deeply but, you will also get an experience of using them on the night. That’s right; you get to experiment with making deep connections during the talk; so there is potential for you to make a lifelong friend, colleague or lover right there!<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/4\/2\/8\/600_441125160.jpeg\"><\/p> \n<p><b>About David:<\/b><\/p> \n<p>For a large part of his life he was anxious, lazy, depressed and addicted to one thing or another. Over the past few years he has taken himself from that place to where he is now: passionate, excited, fulfilled and full of wonderment.<\/p> \n<p>David made the leap last year from an uninspiring office job to being self employed. He works with small business owners, CEOs, elite athletes, corporate employees, professional coaches or anyone he is excited by. He gets them to see what they cannot, to create far more than they ever dreamed possible and overcome any obstacle that stands in their way.<\/p> \n<p>He is passionate about his family and has built his life and business around his amazing 100 year old grandma and his incredible mum, who he is proud to support.<\/p> \n<p><b>Feedback from Interesting Talk's members from when David gave this talk last time;<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Rosie&nbsp;<\/b>\"Was a brilliant event!

The Champion Bermuda greens are an outstanding putting surface – called the bent grass of the south – we believe we have one of the finest sets of greens in Houston public golf. The fairways and tee boxes are always in top notch shape.&nbsp; A burn runs through the property and water comes into play on 14 of the 18 holes.&nbsp; The course plays anywhere from 5145 yards to 6914 yards.&nbsp; We have 4 sets of tees, so finding the correct distance for your game should never be a problem.&nbsp; <br><\/p>","mtime":1478611059119,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/The-Weekend-Golfer\/events\/235282819\/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"payment_required":"0","name":"Southwyck Golf Club - Saturday Nov 12th","id":"235282819","time":1478967300000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","country":"us","city":"Houston","name":"The Weekend Golfer for Singles","group_lon":-95.22,"id":19649535,"state":"TX","urlname":"The-Weekend-Golfer","category":{"name":"sports\/recreation","id":32,"shortname":"sports-recreation"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/0\/a\/highres_450267658.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/0\/a\/600_450267658.jpeg","photo_id":450267658,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/c\/0\/a\/thumb_450267658.jpeg"},"group_lat":29.72},"status":"upcoming"}

After watching me give a few \"readings\" in the hills of Georgia, he got all excited and encouraged me to offer readings to people the way he did.<\/p> \n<p>Years before even meeting \"Uncle,\" as Manny was known to his sundancers, I had developed the ability to read stones \"cold,\" that is, without any kind of aid or guide, just direct information from Spirit through a set of stones I used that had been selected and handled by the person I was trying to help.<\/p> \n<p>During a reading, I&nbsp;use&nbsp;a set of Manny's stones the way he taught me, but along with that I will integrate my way (and stones)&nbsp;also. Readings last a half hour, which is all anyone should require. Don't try to get everything all at once; you might get overwhelmed.<\/p> \n<p>If you schedule a reading,&nbsp;<i>please be prompt<\/i>&nbsp;as I cannot allow it to overrun. Stone reading&nbsp;is based on the spiritual practices of certain&nbsp;Indian people and predates European interference with our wisdom teachings, what some might call \"religion.\"<\/p> \n<p><i>\"I thought your reading was really insightful and helpful...I also think anyone who has been a student of yours learning about the animals as medicine helpers, the labyrinth, and so on will gain special insight from your readings.<\/i><\/p> \n<p><i>...(your) Stone People Medicine reading guided me to look at the energy of my current life challenges in both a spiritual way and also a very practical way that allows clearer navigation through life on a daily basis.\"<\/i><\/p> \n<p><i>MEC, professional reader, WPB<\/i><\/p> \n<p><i>\"Amazing and so very accurate.

Grandfather Rick's insight is very profound.\"<\/i><\/p> \n<p><i>JG, PB, FL<\/i><\/p> \n<p>Rick McBride is mixedblood Tsalagi (Cherokee) who has walked the Red Road for over 30 years. He was named Cante Lute (Schan-tay Lou-tuh) by the spirits through his sundance chief, which means Red Heart. He is a sundancer and has been traditionally trained and authorized to lead ceremonies, such as inipi (purification lodge), prayer with the Canunpah (Pipe), drum healing and so forth. He has been publicly teaching these ways for some ten years now. Workshops and lectures are one way to learn from the wisdom of Indian Country. Ceremony brings this knowledge to life. Combined, teaching and ceremony render practical guidance to everyday living. And so, Rick sees his role as that of \"translator\" of indigenous ways so that mainstream-educated people get the full benefit of these ways. It has taken him years of dedicated interaction with many Elders, as well as his activities as ceremonial leader to get to this place in his life.<\/p> \n<p><b>For further information, visit his website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mixedblood.info\">www.mixedblood.info<\/a><\/b><\/p> \n<br>\n<br>","mtime":1478611223601,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/South-Florida-Spiritual-Awakening\/events\/235023642\/","yes_rsvp_count":2,"duration":14400000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Stone People Medicine Readings","id":"235023642","time":1478624400000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"West Palm Beach","name":"South Florida Spiritual Awakening, Healing, Reiki","group_lon":-80.13,"id":1468381,"state":"FL","urlname":"South-Florida-Spiritual-Awakening","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/d\/2\/highres_165297042.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/d\/2\/600_165297042.jpeg","photo_id":165297042,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/e\/d\/2\/thumb_165297042.jpeg"},"group_lat":26.66},"status":"deleted"}

Personally I'm skeptical that Indians would wait until the last minute to&nbsp;build their wardrobe. My theory is that Full Beaver Moon comes from the point of view of the beavers as they make their own&nbsp;preparations for winter. It's also called the Frosty Moon.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><b>Internet Lore<br><\/b><span>Seems like we keep hearing about a “supermoon\" almost every month. “This full moon will be the biggest since...

I hope you know that astrology is not astronomy (any more), but we can still&nbsp;have fun with it. Not sure I should reveal my opinion about astrology, but here’s a glimpse - a debate between a true believer and a&nbsp;sceptic:<\/p>\n<p><span>Believer: What’s your sign?<br><\/span><span>Sceptic:&nbsp;Scorpio, but I’m not \"resourceful, brave, passionate, stubborn and a true friend.” I’m not any of the things that it says I’m&nbsp;supposed to be.<br><\/span><span>Believer: I’m not surprised. That is SOOOOO typical of a Scorpio.<\/span><\/p> \n<p><b>PUZZLER<\/b>: What is the difference between and “supermoon” and a “super-duper moon?” (And how can so many full moons be “super” if&nbsp;we keep hearing about them?) And why did NO supermoons occur before 2011??!!!<\/p> \n<p><b>PUZZLER ANSWER:<\/b> &nbsp;When the full moon is bigger than average, it’s often billed as a “supermoon.” First of all, the moon is not actually&nbsp;bigger; it just looks bigger because it’s closer to the earth. The moon’s orbit around the earth is elliptical; the distance between its&nbsp;closest point (perigee) and furthest point (apogee) is 48,000 km. Of course, the closest point doesn’t necessarily happen to coincide&nbsp;with the time of a full moon. However, this month is the second in a triad of supermoons. It seems logical to me that supermoons come&nbsp;in clusters because the full moon will be at similar points in its orbit several months in a row as the period between full moons averages&nbsp;29.5 days while the period of the moon’s orbit is about 27.3 days.<\/p> \n<p>This month the precise moment of full moon will occur within 2 hours of perigee. That makes this full moon closer to earth than any time&nbsp;between 1948 and 2034. So many are&nbsp;calling it a “Super-duper moon.” How much bigger and brighter will it appear? 14% bigger and&nbsp;30% brighter than at its greatest distance (\"micromoon”). Of course that makes it only about 7% bigger than average and 16% brighter&nbsp;than average. So I would call the whole supermoon thing the Donald Trump of media hype.<\/p> \n<p>Why no supermoons before 2011? Because the term first became popularized and used by the media for the full moon of March 2011.<\/p>\n<p>For more:&nbsp;http:\/\/earthsky.org\/?p=190918<\/p> \n<p><b>ciao for niao,<br><\/b><b>Captain Bob<\/b><\/p>","mtime":1478611298114,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Paris-Full-Moon-Picnic-Group\/events\/235438134\/","yes_rsvp_count":2,"payment_required":"0","name":"attend Full Moon Picnic Mon 14 Nov from 5:30 to 7:30 PM","id":"235438134","time":1479141000000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"fr","city":"Paris","name":"Paris Full Moon Picnic Group","group_lon":2.34,"id":1427036,"urlname":"Paris-Full-Moon-Picnic-Group","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/3\/7\/highres_7997207.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/3\/7\/600_7997207.jpeg","photo_id":7997207,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/3\/7\/thumb_7997207.jpeg"},"group_lat":48.86},"status":"upcoming"}

We had a Bulbasaur on our Nearby lists at pretty muchall times. Since softball season was over, one field in particular was basically swarming with 10-20 Pokémon GO players. It was cool seeing all those people out there, and it's that kind of environment we hope to encounter again! Hopefully everyone will walk away much closer to a Venusaur.<\/p> \n<p>I'm very excited to announce we'll be joined by OSU's resident Pokémon group, the Buckeye Pokémon League! This OSU student organization with a love of anything Pokémon also functions as an officially sanctioned 'Play! Pokémon' location for card games and video games, and occasionally hosts official tournaments at OSU. Anyone is welcome, whether you attend OSU or not. The club currently meets from 7-10 PM on Mondays in the basement of the Student Union, in the Milestones room (but you can ask me, Brian, at any time if that needs confirmed, as they tend to only meet when OSU has classes).<\/p> \n<p>We'll come straight here from our OSU event, and we'll be at it here until dark (estimated 5:30-6 PM). Since we don't have a lot of time, we will not wait 15 minutes for people to show up as we have, we'll just go out there.

And why did NO supermoons occur before 2011??!!!<\/p>\n<p><b>PUZZLER ANSWER:<\/b> &nbsp;When the full moon is bigger than average, it’s often billed as a “supermoon.” First of all, the moon is not actually&nbsp;bigger; it just looks bigger because it’s closer to the earth. The moon’s orbit around the earth is elliptical; the distance between its&nbsp;closest point (perigee) and furthest point (apogee) is 48,000 km. Of course, the closest point doesn’t necessarily happen to coincide&nbsp;with the time of a full moon. However, this month is the second in a triad of supermoons. It seems logical to me that supermoons come&nbsp;in clusters because the full moon will be at similar points in its orbit several months in a row as the period between full moons averages&nbsp;29.5 days while the period of the moon’s orbit is about 27.3 days.<\/p>\n<p>This month the precise moment of full moon will occur within 2 hours of perigee. That makes this full moon closer to earth than any time&nbsp;between 1948 and 2034. So many are&nbsp;calling it a “Super-duper moon.” How much bigger and brighter will it appear? 14% bigger and&nbsp;30% brighter than at its greatest distance (\"micromoon”). Of course that makes it only about 7% bigger than average and 16% brighter&nbsp;than average. So I would call the whole supermoon thing the Donald Trump of media hype.<\/p>\n<p>Why no supermoons before 2011? Because the term first became popularized and used by the media for the full moon of March 2011.<\/p> \n<p>For more:&nbsp;http:\/\/earthsky.org\/?p=190918<\/p>\n<p><b>ciao for niao,<br><\/b><b>Captain Bob<\/b><\/p>","mtime":1478611401345,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Paris-Full-Moon-Picnic-Group\/events\/235438134\/","yes_rsvp_count":2,"payment_required":"0","name":"attend Full Moon Picnic Mon 14 Nov from 5:30 to 7:30 PM","id":"235438134","time":1479141000000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"fr","city":"Paris","name":"Paris Full Moon Picnic Group","group_lon":2.34,"id":1427036,"urlname":"Paris-Full-Moon-Picnic-Group","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/3\/7\/highres_7997207.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/3\/7\/600_7997207.jpeg","photo_id":7997207,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/3\/3\/7\/thumb_7997207.jpeg"},"group_lat":48.86},"status":"upcoming"}

They're exposed to crimes and abuses if they're gone home early after school. Isn't it sad?<\/p> \n<p>If you have 2-3 hours of free time you'd contribute to education and wellbeing of these kids before enjoying fun and splendid Saturday afternoon in this city, let's help them together.<\/p> \n<p>I told to the Center staff that our volunteers need a break on weekends, and may not have enough time to prepare a lot to teach them systematically but leading some conversation and reading sessions may be doable.

We acquire this knowledge through the use of consciousness. Meditation is the art of developing the consciousness in all its levels. <br> <br> Common schools of meditation such as Transcendental Meditation and Vipassana only focus on the preliminary stages of meditation. While they may provide an increased feeling of relaxation and inner peace, they lack the depth that is needed to truly go beyond the mind and experience the great mysteries of life.<br> <br> A true sanyasin of meditation is able to leave their physical body at will and intimately fuse with that which they are meditating on. Real meditation is not a practice of zoning out at all; it is an intimate experience of the consciousness that leads to mystical ecstasy and tangible experience of the internal worlds. To be able to truly meditate takes years of daily practice and this course will provide the foundation, suitable for both beginners and advanced, to begin to walk on this path...<\/p> \n<p>Each session will comprise of a talk and meditation practice.

The knowledge graph is positioned to be the next thing big thing in terms of data integration and search, but what is it and where can you get one? The next question might be: should I care? The answer is a definite YES and in this presentation I will justify this claim by highlighting the benefits to data scientists. These include: easy integration of multiple data sources, a flexible schema to check correctness and express how the information is related, and an intuitive graph query language to extract information across all sources.<\/p>\n<p>Sheldon&nbsp;Hall is a software engineer working at Grakn Labs where a distributed knowledge graph is being developed. His current role involves research and development of our graph based knowledge representation system and analytics engine.

As adults, we usually continue them to try to get what we wanted in our childhood, often unsuccessfully. A lot of these strategies and feelings are also stored in our body-mind, in how we hold ourselves and how we react to what we see, hear, smell or feel. <\/p> \n<p>The key to breaking these patterns is to discover the roots of the emotions, give them loving space to complete, and reform them with the loving, supportive messages and sensations that set us free. PHI offers a very powerful, synergistic combination of tools to make this transformation.<\/p> \n<p>Pelvic Heart Integration is a comprehensive system for understanding and harmonizing the whole person, in our intimate relationships with ourselves and others. This unique and powerful synthesis of neo-Reichian breathwork, bodywork, psycho-drama, trauma work, energy work and tantra was developed by pioneering philosopher and bodyworker Dr. Jack Painter and extended by Psychologist Dr. Deborah Anapol. It examines our ancestral lineage and the developmental issues of childhood and their relationship to the physical, emotional, interpersonal and sexual issues confronting us as evolving humans. It uses excitement and sensual pleasure for healing experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Your Facilitator ------------ <\/p>\n<p>Gregory Fung was being trained in PHI by the late Dr. Deborah Anapol and brings his experience exploring and integrating techniques from yoga, massage, tantric meditation, conscious kink, body dearmouring, Gestalt dialoging, and for creating a safe relaxing space of deep presence. Having grown up in Vancouver, Canada, he is still active in his first career as an electronics and embedded software engineer, where he developed his experience in team dynamics. He also converses in German and Cantonese. In Berlin, he offers personalized sessions for emotional exploration and release, meditative and breath coaching, and energetic bodywork. <\/p>\n<br>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pelvicheart.de\">www.pelvicheart.de<\/a><\/p> \n<p>Location------------------ <br>UnitedBliss, <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=Jessnerstra%C3%9Fe%2018%2C%2010247%20Berlin%2C%20Germany&amp;authuser=0\">Jessnerstraße 18, 10247 Berlin, Germany<\/a><br><\/p> \n<p>Contribution ----------------- <br>Pay-as-you-feel-deeply right, suggestion €5 - 15<\/p> \n<p>Registration ----------------- <br>Please write to [masked] secure your place.<\/p>","mtime":1478611617441,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/PHI_Berlin\/events\/235098764\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Breath practice evening 8.11","id":"235098764","time":1478629800000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"de","city":"Berlin","name":"Pelvic Heart Integration in Berlin","group_lon":13.38,"id":19160450,"urlname":"PHI_Berlin","category":{"name":"new age\/spirituality","id":22,"shortname":"new-age-spirituality"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/d\/a\/highres_444556602.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/d\/a\/600_444556602.jpeg","photo_id":444556602,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/0\/d\/a\/thumb_444556602.jpeg"},"group_lat":52.52},"status":"upcoming"}

With the growth of not just bitcoin, but a slew of decentralized blockchain applications, the problem becomes exponentially more challenging.

Single-sign-on solutions from Facebook and Google have been pervasive throughout centralized websites, and have brought simplicity to account management.
