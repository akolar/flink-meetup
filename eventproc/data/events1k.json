Podríamos identificar este enfoque como una transformación guiada por el cambio en la forma de hacer las cosas.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>Este tipo de transformaciones se ven desafiadas muy frecuentemente al tiempo que las personas cambian de proyectos, de áreas, se suman nuevas personas, etc. Tanto es el desafío que enfrentan, que algunas veces se ve una total retracción de la agilidad, volviendo a hacer las cosas como si aquí nunca haya existido una transformación.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p>En esta conversación veremos algunos factores que influyen en este tipo de situaciones y analizaremos una dimensión de la transformación organizacional a la cual no se le da la prioridad que merece. Y esta dimensión es, justamente, el factor principal por la cual las transformaciones fallan en su cometido.<\/p> \n<p>¿Qué es eso que estamos olvidando al pretender acompañar a una organización en su transformación? Participa de la conversación y descubrámoslo juntos. Abramos la puerta hacia adentro.&nbsp;<\/p> \n<p><b>Día, Hora y Lugar<\/b> <br>• Día: Miércoles 9 de Noviembre de 2016 <br>• Hora: 19:30 a 21:00 horas <br><b>• Lugar: <a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=Bulevar%20Espa%C3%B1a%202323%2C%20Montevideo\">Pyxis Edificio<\/a>&nbsp;<\/b><span>Bulevar España 2323, Montevideo&nbsp;<\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>¡Gracias Pyxis por recibirnos nuevamente!<\/span><\/p> \n<p>¡Te esperamos!<\/p>","mtime":1478608240757,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/AgileUY\/events\/235127267\/","yes_rsvp_count":50,"duration":5400000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Bienvenid@s, la puerta abre hacia adentro.

Many films of recent years have been set in classrooms, but few have been as intense, well played and succinct as Biček's directorial debut.<br><\/p>\n<p>Robert, the new German teacher, is aloof, authorative and demanding. He lectures on Thomas Mann and expects his pupils to rise when he enters the room. He might even be a Nazi, the dismayed teenagers speculate. When his student Sabina takes her own life shortly after being reprimanded by Robert, the teacher is considered to be cause. Instantly, vengeful youth rebellion stirs among the benches. The realisation that things are not so black and white comes too late.<br><\/p>\n<p><b>Awards:<\/b>&nbsp; 20 wins &amp; 5 nominations<br><b>IMDB rating:<\/b>&nbsp;7.8<br><b>Running time:<\/b>&nbsp; 1 hour 52 mins<\/p>\n<p>The movie will start at 7.30pm, but I will get there from about 7.00pm to set up the room.

You will see what dynamics have led to the situation\/issue and will be able to address the root of it by being held in a safe space with healing words and expression of emotions. This is a creative, intuitive process and goes very deep, but may give you sustainable results. A new perspective plus higher awareness, as well as a changed attitude will help you see your path ahead more clearly and eventually lead into more peace within yourself.<\/p> \n<p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ring me on 07894434295.<\/p> \n<p>If money is what is holding you back, please talk to me.

Harry's charming, down-home manner hides a malicious penchant for stirring up trouble, and he exerts a strange and powerful effect on Gideon and his thoroughly assimilated black, middle-class family.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s5PWGIb6vhc\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s5PWGIb6vhc<\/a><\/p>\n<p>What: To Sleep with Anger&nbsp;<br>When: Tuesday, November 8, 2015 &nbsp;7:00 PM&nbsp;<br>Where: BloomBars - community&nbsp;arts space.&nbsp;<br>Directions:&nbsp;The location is 7 minutes walking distance from the Columbia Heights METRO Station (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/Columbia+Heights+Station\/BloomBars,+11th+Street,+NW,+Washington,+DC\/@38.9294136,-77.0323002,17z\/am=t\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x89b7c81f9c6e6db9:0x42caacd52fed6e75!2m2!1d-77.032427!2d38.9288997!3m4!1m2!1d-77.0297201!2d38.9292322!3s0x89b7c81ef0f6edc7:0xdfa91290fd4d63d0!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c81ea440c991:0xb5cc9930df8a4884!2m2!1d-77.0280419!2d38.9302017!3e2\">map<\/a>), and a couple of local parking garages - Target (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/DC+USA,+3100+14th+St+NW,+Washington,+DC+20010\/BloomBars,+11th+Street,+NW,+Washington,+DC\/@38.9299782,-77.0347272,16z\/am=t\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c821d7205bad:0x6bd75c5465c0029c!2m2!1d-77.0331896!2d38.9295547!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c81ea440c991:0xb5cc9930df8a4884!2m2!1d-77.0280419!2d38.9302017!3e2\">map<\/a>) and Giant (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/Giant,+1345+Park+Rd+NW,+Washington,+DC+20010\/BloomBars,+3222+11th+Street,+NW,+Washington,+DC+20001\/@38.9307373,-77.0324329,17z\/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x89b7c81f38e9007f:0x1173e4be652e2e68!2m2!1d-77.0320803!2d38.9308112!3m4!1m2!1d-77.0286351!2d38.9306927!3s0x89b7c81eb1a15479:0xb5ca9b35c14bef2a!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c81ea440c991:0xb5cc9930df8a4884!2m2!1d-77.0280419!2d38.9302017!3e2\">map<\/a>).<\/p>","mtime":1478608670387,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/DCHistoryAndCulture\/events\/235437550\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"duration":7200000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Election Night Escape! 90's Classic \"To Sleep with Anger\" w\/ Q&A","id":"235437550","time":1478649600000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"Washington","name":"Washington, DC History & Culture","group_lon":-77.06,"id":6913562,"state":"DC","urlname":"DCHistoryAndCulture","category":{"name":"education\/learning","id":6,"shortname":"education-learning"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/e\/e\/highres_449351502.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/e\/e\/600_449351502.jpeg","photo_id":449351502,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/c\/e\/e\/thumb_449351502.jpeg"},"group_lat":38.94},"status":"upcoming"}

Last year, this trip and workshop filled up less than two weeks after it was announced!&nbsp;These trips are very popular and only a limited number of people are allowed to go down the Grand Canyon each year.

It’s still officially “Summer” on our first three days, so it should be nice and warm. Although it rarely gets over 100 degrees at this time of the year, a quick dip in the water will cool you off. The large, motorized J-rig rafts are very safe and roomy (we will have 14 people on each boat compared to the normal 18). There are about 15 white water rapids on this 100-mile stretch of the Colorado. You have the option of staying fairly dry in the back of the raft, or getting wet in the front. All your meals are prepared for you (the food is amazing), and all your camping equipment is provided (cots, tents, sleeping bags, chairs and a water-resistant bag to place your camera and other personals). There is very little hiking involved. All transportation and transfers from Las Vegas to and from the river are provided.<\/p> \n<p><b>Weather<\/b>: Mid-September offers the perfect temperatures! May and Sept. are the best months to visit the bottom of the canyon. Day temps are usually 85º - 95º, with evening temps between 65º - 75º. April can be a little cold. June, July and August are often over 100º in the day. The canyon walls radiate stored heat into the evening, typically keeping the temperatures above 80º much of the night.<\/p> \n<p><b>See the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernriver.com\/grand-canyon-rafting-tour#prettyPhoto\/0\/\">Overview\/Video<\/a> and Download the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernriver.com\/downloads\/expedition-guides\/grand_canyon_gc4.pdf\">Brochure<\/a><\/b><\/p> \n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/4\/9\/600_454593353.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><b>This is one of my few group workshops for 2017<\/b>: most are <a href=\"http:\/\/intothenightphoto.blogspot.com\/2015\/09\/private-nightscape-photography.html\">private workshops<\/a> (with 2-4 people per workshop) going on next year.

Your transition from civilization to wilderness includes horseback trail rides, horseshoes, ping pong, skeet shooting, dinner and evening entertainment before settling into bed in the lodge, outdoors in a covered wagon, or outside on a spacious deck.

Participating in Kaggle competitions can be very time-consuming. For this reason, I would like to build an automatic machine learning solution that suits most of the datasets with reasonable results. This talk also gives an overview of the main functions in H2O as well as real-world use cases.<\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;20h15-21h Sparkling Water 2.0 - Jakub Háva<\/p> \n<p>Sparkling Water integrates the H2O open source distributed machine learning platform with the capabilities of Apache Spark. It allows users to leverage H2O’s machine learning algorithms with Apache Spark applications via Scala, Python, R or H2O’s Flow GUI which makes Sparkling Water a great enterprise solution. Sparkling Water 2.0 was built to coincide with the release of Apache Spark 2.0 and introduces several new features. These include the ability to use H2O frames as Apache Spark’s SQL datasource, transparent integration into Apache Spark machine learning pipelines, the power to use Apache Spark algorithms via the Flow GUI and easier deployment of Sparkling Water in a Python environment. In this talk we will introduce the basic architecture of Sparkling Water and provide an overview of the new features available in Sparkling Water 2.0. The talk will also include a live demo showing how to integrate H2O algorithms into Apache Spark pipelines – no terminal needed!<\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;21h jusqu’au bout de la nuit :<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/xe-uYwXsYLbQ-OPlvvOhQSwX1ycpWfUwed0NAlT7vzt5Ykz5bIU9n6Zkq2aIRAh7Ne6ij7fRv7atJUwin1XV7hRNkgz33X8y2JWrq0aY5g4hSBVZn7krh3d-MStT1I8bAeJAqCdv\" width=\"624\" height=\"268\"><\/p> \n<br> \n<p><b>About Joe <\/b><\/p> \n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow\">https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow<\/a> <\/p> \n<p>Twitter: @matlabulous<\/p> \n<p>Jo-fai (or Joe) is a data scientist at H2O.ai.

Therefore, we have developed a progressive focus for our classes that starts with clearing the pain and helping us “survive life”, and progresses to finding and living our soul’s mission so that we can “thrive in life”. The Basic level training works at the 1st (physical) and 2nd (emotional) pair of the 12 Strand DNA and provides students with the ability to clear physical and emotional energy blockages from the cellular memory and leave in their place positive physical and emotional energy imprints. Even though we call this class “basic level” this class provides you with everything you need to do a powerful Integrated Energy Therapy session on yourself or on another person (either in person or absentee). This class has been designed to be a wonderful entry level class for those students wanting to use energy therapy to heal their lives, an ideal class for students wanting to begin an energy therapy practice, and it provides a wonderful complement to other holistic techniques such as Massage, Reiki, and Therapeutic Touch.

Everything is provided for in this workshop: prepared meals, air transfers from Las Vegas to the river and back, camping equipment, entertainment, and great photo instruction by NightScape Photographer, Royce Bair.<\/p>\n<p>Four experienced river guides and an assistant photo instructor will accompany us on this adventure.&nbsp;<span>This trip and workshop will be very similar to our <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/NightScape-Photography\/events\/227515545\/\">2016 trip\/workshop<\/a><span> (check out our 5-star rating and comments).<\/span><\/p> \n<p><b>Don't delay making your reservations<\/b>. Last year, this trip and workshop filled up less than two weeks after it was announced!&nbsp;These trips are very popular and only a limited number of people are allowed to go down the Grand Canyon each year. Some individuals have waited for up to 20 years to obtain a permit to float through the canyon.<\/p>\n<p><b>Total Price<\/b>: Photo workshop fee is $200 ($299 after Dec. 31, 2016). River rafting cost is $1699 ($1899 total).

It’s still officially “Summer” on our September schedule, so it should be nice and warm. Although it rarely gets over 100 degrees at this time of the year, a quick dip in the water will cool you off. The large, motorized J-rig rafts are very safe and roomy (we will have 14 people on each boat compared to the normal 18). There are about 15 white water rapids on this 100-mile stretch of the Colorado. You have the option of staying fairly dry in the back of the raft, or getting wet in the front. All your meals are prepared for you (the food is amazing), and all your camping equipment is provided (cots, tents, sleeping bags, chairs and a water-resistant bag to place your camera and other personals). There is very little hiking involved. All transportation and transfers from Las Vegas to and from the river are provided.<\/p> \n<p><b>Weather<\/b>: Mid-September offers the perfect temperatures! May and Sept. are the best months to visit the bottom of the canyon. Day temps are usually 85º - 95º, with evening temps between 65º - 75º. April can be a little cold. June, July and August are often over 100º in the day. The canyon walls radiate stored heat into the evening, typically keeping the temperatures above 80º much of the night.<\/p> \n<p><b>See the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernriver.com\/grand-canyon-rafting-tour#prettyPhoto\/0\/\">Overview\/Video<\/a> and Download the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.westernriver.com\/downloads\/expedition-guides\/grand_canyon_gc4.pdf\">Brochure<\/a><\/b><\/p> \n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/2\/4\/9\/600_454593353.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p><b>This is one of my few group workshops for 2017<\/b>: most are <a href=\"http:\/\/intothenightphoto.blogspot.com\/2015\/09\/private-nightscape-photography.html\">private workshops<\/a> (with 2-4 people per workshop) going on next year.

A motor coach will take you to the Boulder Terminal where you will begin your Grand Canyon tour with a beautiful flight to the Bar 10 Ranch. Before you start your three-day Grand Canyon river rafting adventure, you’ll enjoy an overnight stay at the Bar 10 Ranch, a working cattle ranch perched high on a plateau above the Colorado River. Your transition from civilization to wilderness includes horseback trail rides, horseshoes, ping pong, skeet shooting, dinner and evening entertainment before settling into bed in the lodge, outdoors in a covered wagon, or outside on a spacious deck. Those who have paid the additional $200 photo instruction fee will attend a 2-hour twilight and starry night workshop instruction with Royce Bair before bedding down for the night.<\/p> \n<p><b>DAY 2<\/b> » After a big country breakfast, a helicopter takes you deep into Grand Canyon where your rafts and guides await. After orientation and introductions, you’ll be on your way downriver surrounded by soul-stirring scenery. Breathtaking canyon walls shoot skyward in a dramatic display of geologic history as you experience your first taste of Grand Canyon river rafting. Hold on for Kolb and Mile 209 Rapids!

It’s still officially “Summer” on our September schedule, so it should be nice and warm. Although it rarely gets over 100 degrees at this time of the year, a quick dip in the water will cool you off. The large, motorized J-rig rafts are very safe and roomy (we will have 14 people on each boat compared to the normal 18). There are about 15 white water rapids on this 100-mile stretch of the Colorado. You have the option of staying fairly dry in the back of the raft, or getting wet in the front. All your meals are prepared for you (the food is amazing), and all your camping equipment is provided (cots, tents, sleeping bags, chairs and a water-resistant bag to place your camera and other personals). There is very little hiking involved. All transportation and transfers from Las Vegas to and from the river are provided.<\/p> \n<p><b>Weather<\/b>: Mid-September offers the perfect temperatures! May and Sept. are the best months to visit the bottom of the canyon. Day temps are usually 85º - 95º, with evening temps between 65º - 75º. April can be a little cold.

Before you start your three-day Grand Canyon river rafting adventure, you’ll enjoy an overnight stay at the Bar 10 Ranch, a working cattle ranch perched high on a plateau above the Colorado River. Your transition from civilization to wilderness includes horseback trail rides, horseshoes, ping pong, skeet shooting, dinner and evening entertainment before settling into bed in the lodge, outdoors in a covered wagon, or outside on a spacious deck. Those who have paid the additional $200 photo instruction fee will attend a 2-hour twilight and starry night workshop instruction with Royce Bair before bedding down for the night.<\/p> \n<p><b>DAY 2<\/b> » After a big country breakfast, a helicopter takes you deep into Grand Canyon where your rafts and guides await. After orientation and introductions, you’ll be on your way downriver surrounded by soul-stirring scenery.

I had my first solo art exhibit in NYC, and I simply couldn't focus on anything else, but that's done, and I'm ready to get this back up and running! Since I'm a little late getting this out for this month, I'm moving the date to the very end of November to give us a little more time.<\/p>\n<p>So, the book for November is&nbsp;<span>November- 'Between the World and Me' by Ta Nehisi Coates.&nbsp;In a series of essays, written as a letter to his son, Coates confronts the notion of race in America and how it has shaped American history, many times at the cost of black bodies and lives. Thoughtfully exploring personal and historical events, from his time at Howard University to the Civil War, the author poignantly asks and attempts to answer difficult questions that plague modern society. In this short memoir, the \"Atlantic\" writer explains that the tragic examples of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and those killed in South Carolina are the results of a systematically constructed and maintained assault to black people--a structure that includes slavery, mass incarceration, and police brutality as part of its foundation. From his passionate and deliberate breakdown of the concept of race itself to the importance of the Black Lives Matter movement, Coates powerfully sums up the terrible history of the subjugation of black people in the United States. A timely work, this title will resonate with all teens--those who have experienced racism as well as those who have followed the recent news coverage on violence against people of color.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/08\/17\/books\/review\/ta-nehisi-coates-between-the-world-and-me.html?_r=0\">http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/08\/17\/books\/review\/ta-nehisi-coates-between-the-world-and-me.html?_r=0<\/a><br><\/p>\n<p>See you then!<\/p>\n<p>Angelique<\/p>","mtime":1478609159489,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/books-drinks\/events\/235437629\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"payment_required":"0","name":"The book for November is November- 'Between the World and Me' by Ta Nehisi Coate","id":"235437629","time":1480546800000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"Asheville","name":"asheville books & drinks","group_lon":-82.5,"id":12506782,"state":"NC","urlname":"books-drinks","category":{"name":"book clubs","id":18,"shortname":"book-clubs"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/c\/2\/highres_403079842.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/c\/2\/600_403079842.jpeg","photo_id":403079842,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/e\/9\/c\/2\/thumb_403079842.jpeg"},"group_lat":35.59},"status":"upcoming"}

Water Street (Route 43) and head onto the Portage Bike and Hike Crain Avenue trailhead in Kent. You pass the site where Captain Samuel Brady, famed Indian fighter and legendary Kent figure, made his famous leap across the Cuyahoga River. Heading east on the Bike and Hike along an active rail line, you pass Rockwell Road and Beckwith Orchards on your way to Towner’s Woods County Park.<\/p> \n<p>Cycling through heavy woods covering the trail to Ravenna, you are welcomed to Ravenna by factories and residential neighborhoods. Passing under Route 14, the trail continues to Peck Road where you turn. Cycle back to Kent enjoying the sights and sounds of nature along the trail.<\/p> \n<p>Note: We meet at Riverside Wine. Park in their north parking lot on the other side of the neighboring house. Out and back rides are designed with the intermediate and advanced cyclist in mind. These rides cycle out of a trailhead to a set destination, typically 8-10 miles away. After a break, the riders cycle back to the departure trailhead.<\/p> \n<p>Tonight’s ride travels at 10-12 mph and typically takes 2 hours including photo-ops and rest stops. The ride is rated for leisure cyclists who enjoy cycling 10-12 mph on flat trails with an occasional hill or elevation gain.

For ladies, semi-formal probably means a dress or skirt, but I will let people decide for themselves how they want to look their best. <br> <br>There will be a non-refundable $5 charge in order to help prevent no-shows and last minute RSVP changes, so only sign up if you're sure you can make it.&nbsp; The $5 charge does not include the price of your food &amp; drinks. <\/p> \n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/3\/0\/6\/7\/600_455892391.jpeg\"><\/p>\n<p> If anyone wants to help plan games, that would be much appreciated.&nbsp; It would be nice to try to plan some interactive games so that we can get to know each other a little better, or if people just prefer to mingle, that's fine too. If you help with the planning of the event, there will not be a charge for you. The venue closes at 6pm, so we'll have 3 hours to hang out of we need that much time. <br> <\/p> \n<p>Couples are welcome, but you will both need to RSVP individually. <br><br>If this event is a success, we will plan more like it in the future. <br> <br>See you there! <\/p>","mtime":1478609201565,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/singles-1350\/events\/235437559\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"payment_required":"1","name":"Semi-formal Meet & Greet at Jammy Buggars in Lakewood (Guys' RSVP Page)","id":"235437559","time":1481486400000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"Cleveland","name":"The Cleveland 20s and 30s Group","group_lon":-81.68,"id":693119,"state":"OH","urlname":"singles-1350","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/0\/5\/highres_454905317.jpeg","photo_link":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/0\/5\/600_454905317.jpeg","photo_id":454905317,"thumb_link":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/b\/1\/0\/5\/thumb_454905317.jpeg"},"group_lat":41.51},"status":"upcoming"}

A retreat with others may also energize and deepen mindfulness, as well as help to strengthen a sense of sangha (community of spiritual friends).<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p>With these things in mind, we would like to, whenever possible, provide a free monthly half day meditation retreat for those wishing to deepen their mindfulness practice. The location is a private residence in an ideal setting for meditation and a great place to enjoy the beauty of the North Georgia mountains. All you need to bring is the willingness to unplug from your hectic life for a few hours. Meditation cushions and chairs are provided. There is <b>no cost<\/b> for this retreat. Directions to the retreat site and meeting agenda are below.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Bio:<\/strong> Mark is an Insight Meditation teacher, who began his meditation practice more than 40 years ago with insight meditation teachers Joseph Goldstein, Sharon Salzberg, and Jack Kornfield. His primary teacher has been Joseph Goldstein, and he has trained more recently with guiding senior insight teachers Rodney Smith and Narayan Liebenson. His primary teaching emphasis is practical Essential Buddhism and how mindfulness in all aspects of daily life can&nbsp;provide an&nbsp;opportunity for awakening. &nbsp;He has studied with numerous other teachers primarily in the Theravada tradition, but also in the Tibetan and Zen traditions.<\/p> \n<p>He has done 3 three-month silent retreats and dozens of other retreats mostly at the Insight Meditation Society, the Forest Refuge, and the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies.

Beaucoup de studios y ont ainsi leur siège<br>Du crayon à l'ordinateur<br>Il est un peu petit, certes, mais on peut y passer des heures. Le Suginami Animation Museum propose une riche collection de documents sur le cinéma animé. A l'entrée, un brochure en anglais permet de faire le point. L'histoire de l'animation japonaise est ainsi retracée depuis ses origines... en 1907 !<br>Au centre du bâtiment, un mur arbore les dédicaces des grands mangaka venus y donner des conférences. Pour bien comprendre le chemin qui a été fait, une immense frise chronologique présente les grandes dates. Quelques animés d'époque sont diffusé sur une télé noir et blanc, entourée de statuettes de collection. Sur le côté, des espaces de travail sont reconstitués. Ils témoignent de l'évolution des méthodes de production du crayon à l'ordinateur <\/p> \n<p><br><\/p> \n<p>&lt;BBB&gt;<\/p> \n<p>Nakano Broadway<\/p> \n<p>C’est le lieu rêvé pour tout bon collectionneur qui se respecte!

It makes no difference whether you have or haven’t previous experience of singing or music! What is the workshop about?<br>Our sound is the simplest and most ancient of all the sources of our creative power. Many of us experienced a deep disconnection from this source at a very young age when we were told we could not sing or we had ‘no voice’. Something healing and magical occurs when we reconnect to this source and find the sound of our own heart and soul. Through it, we move into a new relationship with our creativity, our wisdom and our innate ability to heal and nurture ourselves, no matter what our journey. What will we be doing?<br>Participants will be introduced to The Naked Voice methodology of sound and voice developed by internationally renowned singer and composer Chloe Goodchild. During the day we will work with singing, silence, movement and play. Who is the Facilitator?<br>Emer has trained for many years with Chloe Goodchild and is an accredited Naked Voice Facilitator. She has also studied with the UK College of Sound Healing. Emer holds an MSc and works as a trainer in community development and holistic well-being.

In ancient Persia, there were seven sacred animals, birds, and flowers believed to have carried the spirit of the Gods. Numerous archeological antiquities and temples have been found that show the connection between animals and dance. These animals were a symbol of the power of life and represented as a spiritual instrument and these seven sacred birds each represented a certain Persian God or Goddess. These rituals and movements are considered the earliest known form of Persian dance and the origin of sacred dance. The origins of Iranian Shamanic rituals, sacred circles, and the mysteries of Sema will also be discussed.<\/p>\n<p><b>Bio: Farima Berenji<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Farima Berenji is an Iranian-born scholar and dance ethnologist, an award winning internationally acclaimed dance artist, a choreographer, instructor, and an archaeologist specializing in ancient, sacred, classical, and folkloric dances of Persia, Ionia, and the Silk Road. Farima has spent her lifetime studying Persian dance, culture, and history. She performs, offers workshops, and lectures worldwide upon request and has appeared in North America, UK, Austria, Czech Republic, Turkey, Mauritius, and Iran. Recognized as one of a few world scholarly experts of ancient and mystical dance ethnology, she travels worldwide to record, research, lecture, perform, educate, and to inspire dynamic creativity and rejuvenation through dance and movement. As a Sufi and semazen, Farima is an exceptionally inspiring instructor strongly connected to spirituality and healing. She infuses spirituality into her dance and teachings to inspire others to explore dance as a powerful means of expressing emotion, facilitating spiritual healing, and to bridge cultures. Farima teaches her own original findings, methods, techniques, and exercises to uncover the connection between the soul and dance movement. United in all her accomplishments is her contribution in advocating art, culture, and dance to help bridge cultural gaps and create respect among all people.

WHAT ARE FUCK UP NIGHTS?<\/p> \n<p>FuckUp Nights is a global movement where stories of failed businesses and projects are told, questioned and celebrated.<\/p> \n<p>The concept evolved from a mezcal-infused conversation between five friends who felt the need to break free from the stigmas surrounding \"failure\". As fellow entrepreneurs and soon-to-be fuckupreneurs, they deeply believed in communicating failure as a positive step everyone must overcome on the road to success.<\/p> \n<p>II. WHY DO WE DO IT?<\/p> \n<p>• Because the majority of professionals don't create the \"project of the year\" in their first attempt<\/p> \n<p>• Because one can learn more from stories of failure than from stories of success.<\/p> \n<p>III. HOW IS IT DONE?<\/p> \n<p>In every FuckUp Night each speaker (3 speakers in this case) tells their story: What was the project? What went wrong? What did they learn? What would they do differently?<\/p> \n<p>For updates of our speakers, future events or questions feel free to contact FuckUp Nights Sydney at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FUNSydney\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FUNSydney<\/a><\/p> \n<p>For more info check you can visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/fuckupnights.com\/\">http:\/\/fuckupnights.com\/<\/a><\/p>","mtime":1478609488209,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/FuckUp-Nights-Sydney\/events\/235319988\/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"payment_required":"0","name":"FuckUp Nights Sydney Vol. 3","id":"235319988","time":1479282300000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"au","city":"Sydney","name":"FuckUp Nights Sydney","group_lon":151.21,"id":19974092,"urlname":"FuckUp-Nights-Sydney","category":{"name":"career\/business","id":2,"shortname":"career-business"},"group_lat":-33.87},"status":"upcoming"}

This will be useful for attendees who are not familiar with H2O.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;19h30-20h15 Automatic Machine Learning using H2O - Jiqiong QIU <\/p>\n<p>In this talk, I am going to talk about a general machine learning pipeline using H2O for a Kaggle competition (data mining competition). Participating in Kaggle competitions can be very time-consuming. For this reason, I would like to build an automatic machine learning solution that suits most of the datasets with reasonable results. This talk also gives an overview of the main functions in H2O as well as real-world use cases.<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;20h15-21h Sparkling Water 2.0 - Jakub Háva<\/p>\n<p>Sparkling Water integrates the H2O open source distributed machine learning platform with the capabilities of Apache Spark. It allows users to leverage H2O’s machine learning algorithms with Apache Spark applications via Scala, Python, R or H2O’s Flow GUI which makes Sparkling Water a great enterprise solution. Sparkling Water 2.0 was built to coincide with the release of Apache Spark 2.0 and introduces several new features. These include the ability to use H2O frames as Apache Spark’s SQL datasource, transparent integration into Apache Spark machine learning pipelines, the power to use Apache Spark algorithms via the Flow GUI and easier deployment of Sparkling Water in a Python environment. In this talk we will introduce the basic architecture of Sparkling Water and provide an overview of the new features available in Sparkling Water 2.0. The talk will also include a live demo showing how to integrate H2O algorithms into Apache Spark pipelines – no terminal needed!<\/p>\n<p>•&nbsp;21h jusqu’au bout de la nuit :<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/xe-uYwXsYLbQ-OPlvvOhQSwX1ycpWfUwed0NAlT7vzt5Ykz5bIU9n6Zkq2aIRAh7Ne6ij7fRv7atJUwin1XV7hRNkgz33X8y2JWrq0aY5g4hSBVZn7krh3d-MStT1I8bAeJAqCdv\" width=\"624\" height=\"268\"><\/p>\n<br>\n<p><b>About Joe <\/b><\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow\">https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Twitter: @matlabulous<\/p>\n<p>Jo-fai (or Joe) is a data scientist at H2O.ai.

This talk also gives an overview of the main functions in H2O as well as real-world use cases.<\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;20h15-21h Sparkling Water 2.0 - Jakub Háva<\/p> \n<p>Sparkling Water integrates the H2O open source distributed machine learning platform with the capabilities of Apache Spark. It allows users to leverage H2O’s machine learning algorithms with Apache Spark applications via Scala, Python, R or H2O’s Flow GUI which makes Sparkling Water a great enterprise solution. Sparkling Water 2.0 was built to coincide with the release of Apache Spark 2.0 and introduces several new features. These include the ability to use H2O frames as Apache Spark’s SQL datasource, transparent integration into Apache Spark machine learning pipelines, the power to use Apache Spark algorithms via the Flow GUI and easier deployment of Sparkling Water in a Python environment. In this talk we will introduce the basic architecture of Sparkling Water and provide an overview of the new features available in Sparkling Water 2.0. The talk will also include a live demo showing how to integrate H2O algorithms into Apache Spark pipelines – no terminal needed!<\/p> \n<p>•&nbsp;21h jusqu’au bout de la nuit :<\/p> \n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/xe-uYwXsYLbQ-OPlvvOhQSwX1ycpWfUwed0NAlT7vzt5Ykz5bIU9n6Zkq2aIRAh7Ne6ij7fRv7atJUwin1XV7hRNkgz33X8y2JWrq0aY5g4hSBVZn7krh3d-MStT1I8bAeJAqCdv\" width=\"624\" height=\"268\"><\/p>\n<br> \n<p><b>About Joe <\/b><\/p> \n<p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow\">https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/jofaichow<\/a> <\/p> \n<p>Twitter: @matlabulous<\/p> \n<p>Jo-fai (or Joe) is a data scientist at H2O.ai.

Our hike will take us&nbsp;across fields and woodlands&nbsp;before a strenuous ascent&nbsp;to Leith Hill. The summit is the highest of the&nbsp;Greensand Ridge and its tower is&nbsp;the highest point in south-east England. <br>Leith Hill will accommodate us for our lunch as it's been&nbsp;a renowned spot for picnic since the 19th century. Afterwards,&nbsp;if we're feeling energetic, we will climb the 74 spiral steps of the 18th century tower of&nbsp;Leith Hill&nbsp;to&nbsp;its top where through the telescope you can see the English Channel on a clear day. Many of London's landmarks could be seen&nbsp;with the naked eye, too.<br><br><br>After lunch,&nbsp;we descent Leith Hill to head north to Dorking via Greensand way. Much of the&nbsp;route passes ancient woods with&nbsp;amazing displays of colour.&nbsp;Greensand way will take us along paths which give unparalleled views across the Weald&nbsp;and towards the North Downs. The way passes through Tilling Springs&nbsp;- the source of&nbsp;River Tillingbourne which is 11 miles long and&nbsp;runs through several villages powering their mills along the way. From there, we will&nbsp;hike towards the hills upto the North Downs Way and pass by an old WWII&nbsp;pillbox.&nbsp; The path offers beautiful view points which overlook the valley&nbsp;towards Dorking.&nbsp;<br>Then, hiking through woodland for a while, the path comes to Ranmore Common and the beautiful church of St Barnabas built in 1860.&nbsp;From the&nbsp;Church, we continue through Denbies Wine Estate - England’s largest vineyard. The way through the Vineyard rewards with excellent views towards Dorking and Boxhill. Our hike finishes with the picturesque market town of Dorking located west from the Holmesdale hills range. <br><br><\/p> \n<p><span><span><strong>Transport and Meeting Point<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span>We'll meet at Victoria station from 8:00am&nbsp;and leave the meeting point at<\/span>&nbsp;8:15 for the 8<span>:31<\/span>train<\/p> \n<p>Planed return time to London of 6:34pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for&nbsp;the&nbsp;day until then) <br><\/p> \n<p><span>We'll meet between WHSmith (no 34) and the stall called Breadbox (no 29) - both of which can be seen on the map here of our meeting point:&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/LCf81\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/LCf81<\/a><\/p> \n<p><span><span><strong> <br><\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p> \n<p><span><span><strong>Food<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p> \n<p>We will stop during the walk for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

Our hike will take us&nbsp;across fields and woodlands&nbsp;before a strenuous ascent&nbsp;to Leith Hill. The summit is the highest of the&nbsp;Greensand Ridge and its tower is&nbsp;the highest point in south-east England. <br>Leith Hill will accommodate us for our lunch as it's been&nbsp;a renowned spot for picnic since the 19th century. Afterwards,&nbsp;if we're feeling energetic, we will climb the 74 spiral steps of the 18th century tower of&nbsp;Leith Hill&nbsp;to&nbsp;its top where through the telescope you can see the English Channel on a clear day. Many of London's landmarks could be seen&nbsp;with the naked eye, too.<br><br><br>After lunch,&nbsp;we descent Leith Hill to head north to Dorking via Greensand way. Much of the&nbsp;route passes ancient woods with&nbsp;amazing displays of colour.&nbsp;Greensand way will take us along paths which give unparalleled views across the Weald&nbsp;and towards the North Downs. The way passes through Tilling Springs&nbsp;- the source of&nbsp;River Tillingbourne which is 11 miles long and&nbsp;runs through several villages powering their mills along the way. From there, we will&nbsp;hike towards the hills upto the North Downs Way and pass by an old WWII&nbsp;pillbox.&nbsp; The path offers beautiful view points which overlook the valley&nbsp;towards Dorking.&nbsp;<br>Then, hiking through woodland for a while, the path comes to Ranmore Common and the beautiful church of St Barnabas built in 1860.&nbsp;From the&nbsp;Church, we continue through Denbies Wine Estate - England’s largest vineyard. The way through the Vineyard rewards with excellent views towards Dorking and Boxhill. Our hike finishes with the picturesque market town of Dorking located west from the Holmesdale hills range. <br><br><\/p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Transport and Meeting Point<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>We'll meet at Victoria station from 8:00am&nbsp;and leave the meeting point at<\/span>&nbsp;8:15 for the 8<span>:31<\/span>train<\/p>\n<p>Planed return time to London of 6:34pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for&nbsp;the&nbsp;day until then) <br><\/p>\n<p><span>We'll meet between WHSmith (no 34) and the stall called Breadbox (no 29) - both of which can be seen on the map here of our meeting point:&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/LCf81\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/LCf81<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span><span><strong> <br><\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Food<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>We will stop during the walk for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

You are welcome to bring a token to represent your intention if you so desire, and place it on the Community Altar as we journey together.<\/p>\n<p>* Areas set up for meditation, energy work, and community networking. Healthy snacks, tea and water are provided. All ages welcome! Young children should be supervised by parents\/guardians.<\/p>\n<p>* Yoga Mats \/ Back Jacks \/ Chairs available. Feel free to bring your own yoga mats for stretching or lying down.<\/p>\n<p>* We invite volunteer Reiki healers and other energy\/body workers to attend the healing area. Other volunteer opportunities are available as well. Please send us your volunteer inquiries in advance for trade possibilities. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>--------------<\/p>\n<p><b>General Guidelines and Tips<\/b><\/p>\n<p>1. We kindly ask for no talking on the dance floor. This allows for people to go deeper into their Dance and connect with their journey through the elements. (Chat and conversation is welcome in the tea room, outside, or *very* quietly just off the dance floor.)<\/p>\n<p>2. Dance however you want. There is no right or wrong way. Listen to your body and move to the way it feels. Express who you are from the inside out.<\/p>\n<p>3. Respect yourself as well as those around you. Please be mindful to make room for others as you move about the dance floor. Pay attention to your boundaries and the boundaries of others. Communicate through eye contact and body language. Be compassionate and aware. It is our highest intention that this dance is a safe space and sanctuary for community and individual self expression.<br>Suggestion: If you need space, or wish to disengage with another dancer, simply put your hands together in prayer pose and gently bow. This is a clear signal that you want to be in your own space. Mutual respect, always.<\/p>\n<p>4. Bring extra water. &nbsp;This is mainly recommended for those who get very thirsty while exercising, or have a cold.<\/p>\n<p>5. Wear clothes that make you feel good and are comfortable for dancing. Be expressive and colorful if you like, or just show up in your sweats. It's all good! Dancing barefoot or in socks is fine. Shoes are ok, but heavy tread shoes or heels are not allowed. Most dance shoes or slippers are great.<\/p>\n<p>6. This is a Clean &amp; Sober event. &nbsp;No drugs or alcohol of any kind, inside or outside of the body.&nbsp; This would cause you to be asked to leave.<\/p>\n<p>7. Do not bring cameras, or use your phone to take photos.<br><i>Ask the organizers if you have questions about this policy.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>8. ALL ages and genders are welcome.<\/p>\n<p>9. Be yourself!<\/p>\n<p>--------------<\/p>\n<p><b>TIPS FOR THE FIRST TIMER<\/b><\/p>\n<p>* &nbsp;If you have never attended before, please take a few minutes to read.<\/p>\n<p>There will be a brief orientation for newcomers&nbsp;at 8:00 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>Dance Elemental is inspired by ecstatic dance culture and nature-centered spiritual paths. Though you may have attended other ecstatic dance events, Dance Elemental is a unique expression of this form. Music is selected to take you on a journey through the four elements that leads you back to your center (spirit). This is a container created for authentic self expression through dance, meditation in motion, deep play, spiritual centering and community.<\/p>\n<p>Rediscover and liberate your heart of hearts together through dance! &nbsp;<br>We welcome all to the dance. Open your heart, and dissolve any blocks of judgment and fear. Move your body and soul to a handpicked mix of world music, tribal, funk, electronica, trance, ambient and much more. Short, guided meditations are spoken between sections to help transition us from element to element as we journey together through the experience. We are dedicated to providing this touchstone for individual wholeness, healing, growth, and community harmony. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What to expect when you arrive<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Arrive to soft music. Check in first and then quietly find a place for your things. Be welcomed with a cleansing\/smudge (sage or gentle mist). Relax, breathe and stretch as others arrive.<\/p>\n<p>We will be called together for a welcoming circle, speaking of our names, brief orientation, and grounding meditation. Then the dancing starts. &nbsp;Dancing continues until 10:45 or so.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>* Closing<\/p>\n<p>We end with a simple Heart Sharing, with a few words spoken by those who wish to speak about what they experienced, and any gratitudes, etc. There is also time allowed for community announcements just before we part. Remember you are free to bring flyers for your events and put them on the community networking table as well.<\/p>\n<p>--------------<\/p>\n<p><b>Stations&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<p>*&nbsp;Not to be confused with the religious variety.<\/p>\n<p>There are several \"stations\" in our shared space to help you with being present during the dance.<\/p>\n<p>1. Tea Room:&nbsp;Need a refresher? We have a lovely table with healthy snacks to help re-energize and 'ground' you. A great place to chat as well. (Yes, you may bring wholesome finger-foods or beverages to share on the table - please label contents.)<\/p>\n<p>2. Chill out zone:&nbsp;Need to be still for awhile? This is a cozy space set for meditation\/stillness.<\/p>\n<p>3. Healing: &nbsp;Feeling tapped? Reiki Practitioners and experienced Body\/Energy Workers from within our community are often available to offer their care to re-energize and align the participants.<\/p>\n<p>4. Community Altar:&nbsp;This is a space for you to focus your energy and intention, or to draw inspiration from during the dance. Everyone is invited to bring something to place on or near the altar should they feel called.<\/p>\n<p>5. Drumming:&nbsp;There are an assortment of drums\/shakers available for you to play. You may borrow available instruments, or bring your own.&nbsp;<i>Please attend children.<\/i>&nbsp;The goal is to support the dancers by adding to the energy of the music. Sensitivity and awareness is key to holding the energy in the room...&nbsp;<br>Please stay attuned to cues from the DJ and\/or facilitators.<\/p>\n<p>6. Community networking area:&nbsp;This surface is set up near the entrance so that we can get to know one another better. Bring your business cards and brochures, event flyers, freebies, etc. &nbsp;Please take a moment to look through the materials during the evening and collect anything of interest. Seek and ye shall find.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Wow!

Water Street (Route 43) and head onto the Portage Bike and Hike Crain Avenue trailhead in Kent. You pass the site where Captain Samuel Brady, famed Indian fighter and legendary Kent figure, made his famous leap across the Cuyahoga River. Heading east on the Bike and Hike along an active rail line, you pass Rockwell Road and Beckwith Orchards on your way to Towner’s Woods County Park.<\/p>\n<p>Cycling through heavy woods covering the trail to Ravenna, you are welcomed to Ravenna by factories and residential neighborhoods. Passing under Route 14, the trail continues to Peck Road where you turn. Cycle back to Kent enjoying the sights and sounds of nature along the trail.<\/p>\n<p>Note: We meet at Riverside Wine. Park in their north parking lot on the other side of the neighboring house. Out and back rides are designed with the intermediate and advanced cyclist in mind. These rides cycle out of a trailhead to a set destination, typically 8-10 miles away. After a break, the riders cycle back to the departure trailhead.<\/p>\n<p>Today's ride travels at 10-12 mph and typically takes 2 hours including photo-ops and rest stops. The ride is rated for leisure cyclists who enjoy cycling 10-12 mph on flat trails with an occasional hill or elevation gain. The trail surface is mixed with areas of both asphalt and packed limestone. It is relatively flat with some moderate elevation changes. The ride should be a comfortable ride for the intermediate cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>This ride is on the calendar of the Spin-off Cyclists . We encourage you to join us on this and other rides.
